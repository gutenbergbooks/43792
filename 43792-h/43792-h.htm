<p class="center chap">INTRODUCTION</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">The</span> historian who wishes to relate the history of painting in the nineteenth
century is confronted with quite other demands than await him
who undertakes the art of an earlier period. The greatest difficulty with
which the latter has to cope is the deficiency of sources. He manifestly
gropes in the dark with regard to the works of the masters as well as to the
circumstances of their lives. After he has searched archives and libraries
in order to collect his biographical material, the real critical problem awaits
him. Even amongst the admittedly authentic works, those which are undated
confront those whose chronology is certain. To these must be added those
nameless ones, as to whose history there is a doubt; to these again, those
whose origin is to be ascertained. It needs a quick eye to separate the schools
and groups, and finally to recognise the notes which are peculiar to the master.</p>

<p>With none of these difficulties is the historian of modern art confronted.
The painters of the nineteenth century have very seldom forgotten to attach
a name and date to their works, and the circumstances of their lives are related
with an accuracy that was, earlier, rarely the lot of the foremost men in history.
It is all the more difficult, face to face with such a chaos of pictures, to discover
the spiritual bond which connects them all, to construct a building out of the
immense supply of accumulated bricks, the piled-up mass of rough material.
The evolution of modern painting is more complicated and varied than that
of the art of an earlier period, just as modern life itself is more complicated
and varied than that of any previous age.</p>

<p>How quietly, slowly, and surely was the evolution of that older period
carried out. One simple proportion was maintained between art and the
universal life of culture. Customs, views of life and art, were so intimately
bound up together, that the knowledge of the age in general naturally comprises
that of art. Standing before some old altar-piece of the school of Cologne,
it is as though one were watching in some broad high dome; everything is
quiet all round, and the august figures in the picture lead their calm, grave
existence in illustrious grandeur. The message of Christianity, &ldquo;My kingdom
is not of this world,&rdquo; meets in art, too, with a clear expression. Humility
and devotion are joined together, making for a refinement in the feeling of life
that is unsurpassed in its hieratic tenderness and gracious innocence. In the
fifteenth century, the age of discoveries, a new spirit entered the world. Commerce
and navigation discovered new worlds, painting discovered life. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2" id="page2"></a>2</span>
human spirit grew freer and more joyous; it was no longer satisfied with
yearning for the other world alone, it felt itself at home also in this world,
in the glory of the earth. Pictures, too, were inspired with some of those
joyous perceptions with which the citizens of the fifteenth century issued
from their narrow walls out under God&rsquo;s free heaven, something of that Easter
Day mood in <i>Faust</i>. People still went on painting Madonnas and saints,
subjects of a religion which had spread from the far East over the whole
West; but with the severe simplicity of the heavenly, there was universal
awakening of all the charm and roguery and energy of the earthly. It
is the first virginal contact of the spirit with nature. On men&rsquo;s works
there rests the first morning-dew of spiritual life; they remind one of woodlands
in spring: Botticelli, Van Eyck, Schongauer.</p>

<p>After the Italians had become vigorous realists in the fifteenth century,
they rose in the sixteenth, the century of inspired humanism, to majesty.
The time of hard grappling with the overwhelming fulness of actuality is over.
Those great masterpieces ensue in which the unlaboured effort shines forth
in the most felicitous achievement: Raphael, Michael Angelo, Titian. At
the same time the German manner is most directly opposed to the Romance.
They disdain to ingratiate themselves into men&rsquo;s minds by outward grace
of form, but win the heart by their deep religious feeling and intimate
sensibility. They are German to the core, racial even to the stiffness of
the German character, but full of feeling and truth to life. Dürer in
his woodcuts and copper engravings is &ldquo;<i>inwendig voller figur</i>&rdquo;; in them
he offers the &ldquo;concentrated, homely treasure of his heart.&rdquo; Holbein is
great by the incomparably real art of his portraits. The century of that
joyous revival of Paganism, the Olympian vivacity of the Renaissance,
is followed by the age to which the Jesuits gave life and character. For
those stately churches in the Jesuit style, with their <i>fortissimo</i> effect, their
huge, sculptured ornaments and their gleaming, gold decorations, the classic
quietness of the old masters ceases to be appropriate. It is a question of a
more stirring and impressive treatment of sacred subjects, wherein the whole
passion of renewed Catholicism should be brought to expression. Spain,
the country of the Inquisition, set the classic stamp on this enhanced religious
feeling. Here all that monarchical and sacerdotal impulse which founded
and aggrandised the Spanish nation, founded too its true representative in
painting. Painters endowed their church pictures with a passionate fervour
and a flush of extravagant sensuousness of the national, Spanish, local
colour, such as are found united in the art of no other age or country.
Necessarily, moreover, such a feudal system as that of Spain, with its grandees
and princes of the Church, involved also an art of portrait painting which
ranks with the highest that has issued in this kind from any country
whatever: Murillo, Velasquez. In Flanders, the second stronghold of the
Jesuits, we have the titan Rubens. A joyously fleshly Fleming, he seizes
nature by the throat and drags her there where he stands erect, as though
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page3" id="page3"></a>3</span>
he were lord of the world. Freedom had found its way into victorious and
Protestant Holland. Here there flourished an art neither courtly nor fostered
by the Church. It stood in the closest connection with the burgesses, showed
clear signs of the struggle through which country and people had won independence.
In the first place, painting celebrated as its worthiest subject
the free burgher, the tighter in the heroic struggle for freedom. At no time
was portrait-painting practised to such an extent, and the sitters not aristocratic
courtiers, but proud burgesses of a free community; the men grave,
strong, self-reliant; the women faithful, pure, and modest. The workmanship
is correspondent: simple, solid, domestic; and soon there followed the
glorification of that which they prized the more after their struggles had been
accomplished: the quiet, comfortable delight of hearth and home.</p>

<p>During the War of Independence the Dutch had learnt to love their fatherland,
and they were the first, as artists, fully to grasp the poetry of landscape.
Art now no longer shines only upon the eyes of Mary and the Hosts of Heaven:
it settles upon arid country hills, streams upon the sea waves, is at
home in peasants&rsquo; houses and the dark woods, wanders through the streets
and alleys, makes a temple of every market. The religious sentiments,
however, which stirred Protestant Holland had to find appropriate expression;
the living essence of biblical subjects was to be released from a narrow, ecclesiastical
sphere, and approached anew with all the deep, German inwardness.
These tendencies were all united in Rembrandt&mdash;perhaps of all masters,
since the Christian era, the mightiest proclaimer of the great Pan; to him
the cosmic powers of light and air signified the divinity that Michael Angelo
had painted under a beautiful human form.</p>

<p>Finally, in the eighteenth century, comes <i>rococo</i>, with its rustling <i>frou-frou</i>
and its delicate charm. The whole life of that noble society, which
exchanged court costume for silken pastoral garments, formality and rank
for charm and grace, was a lively play, an extravagant game. The king
played with his crown, the priest with his religion, the philosopher with his
wisdom, the poet with the art of rhyme. They did not hear as yet the hoarse
threatening voice of the disinherited, &ldquo;<i>Car tel est notre plaisir</i>.&rdquo; What
this age possessed of beauty and charm, its peculiar grace and wanton vivacity,
its reckless, inassailable frivolity, was proper also to its art. Light and
gracious as the whole life of that harmless, merry generation, it glided through
the age untroubled, led by Cupidons, and kissed by the wandering winds.
It is only to-day that we understand once more the charming masters of
that elegant century.</p>

<p>The painters of every epoch looked at nature with their own eyes, and
also with the eyes of their age and of their country. So the art of every
period appears as &ldquo;the mirror and abstract chronicle&rdquo; of its age. With
irresistible majesty, and conscious of its inspiration, it lays hold of the
external world, and gives back to it its own picture infinitely exalted.
It is the enlightened expression of the age, as upright, as fresh, as fanatic,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page4" id="page4"></a>4</span>
or as unnatural as its generation. Therein lies the strength of the painters
of <i>rococo</i>, that they painted the artificiality of the time with such unsurpassable
naturalness. It is just these infinitely various manners of paying
court to nature&mdash;unceasingly throughout the course of centuries, now
violently, now softly and tenderly, at times, too, not without passing infidelity,&mdash;it
is just these which determine the beauty and value, the mystery and
essence of art, and are in the history of art all that tends to its variety and
unsurpassable charm.</p>

<p>The nineteenth century not only shows a new age, but probably begins a
new section of universal history. It is probable that in contrast with this epoch
of stirring movement, during which the readjustment of all political and social
relations, the new discoveries in the instruments of commerce, trade, and
industry have given an entirely new aspect to the world, the next thousand
years will sum up all the previous centuries as the &ldquo;old world.&rdquo; New men
require a new art. One would be inclined to surmise from this that the art of
the nineteenth century presented itself as something essentially personal, with
a sharply distinctive style. Instead of this it offers at first view, in contrast
with those old ages of uniform production, a condition like that of Babylon.
The nineteenth century has no style&mdash;the phrase that has been so often quoted
as to have become a commonplace. In architecture the forms of all the past
ages live again. The day before yesterday we built Greek, yesterday Gothic;
here <i>Baroque</i>, there Japanese: but amidst all these products of imitative
styles there rise up stations and market-places which, with the robust elegance
of their iron colonnades, herald the greatness of fresh conquests. In the
province of painting there are similar extremes. In no other age have minds
so diverse flourished side by side as Carstens and Goya, Cornelius and Corot,
Ingres and Millet, Wiertz and Courbet, Rossetti and Manet. And the existing
histories excite a belief that the nineteenth century is a chaos into which it is
possible only for some later age to bring order.</p>

<p>Perhaps, however, it is already quite possible, if one only resolves uncompromisingly
to apply to the new age those principles which have been
tested in the treatment of the <i>old</i> histories of art, if one endeavours to study
those artists who are in part still our contemporaries as objectively as though
they were masters long dead. That is to say: one is wont, in a review of
an older period in art, not to inquire what it had caught from an earlier age,
but rather what it had introduced that was new. It was not because they
imitated in their turn that the old masters became great; not because they
looked backwards, but rather because they went forwards, that they made
the history of art. We are not grateful, for instance, to the Dutchmen of
the middle of the sixteenth century&mdash;Frans Floris and his contemporaries&mdash;that
they forsook Dutch naturalism, and bootlessly exerted themselves in the
way of Michael Angelo and Raphael. We can see no remarkable merit in the
fact that the Bolognese at the beginning of the seventeenth century gathered
their honey from the flowers of the Cinquecento. And we are even less inclined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>5</span>
to see in the contemporaries of Adrian van der Werff, who endeavoured to
refine the rugged, primeval Dutch art by the study of the Italians, more than
clumsy imitators.</p>

<p>Just as much will the interest of the historian of the art of the nineteenth
century be bestowed in the first degree upon the works which have really
created something independent and transcending all the earlier ages. He
will not give especial prominence to those domains which had their flowering-time
in other days than our own, but he will ask: Where is that distinctive
element which appertains to the nineteenth century only? What are the
new forms which it has found, the new sentiments to which it has given expression?
Not those whose activity lay in clothing&mdash;however cleverly&mdash;the
artistic necessities of the age in the store of already transmitted
forms, but the pathfinders, who went forwards and created anew, require
our attention. Even if, after the old masters, they can only be granted a
place in the third or fourth class, they must nevertheless always take precedence
of those others, because they exhibited themselves as they were, instead
of making themselves large by standing on the shoulders of the dead. Many
of those who were once valued highly, who, thriving on the inheritance of
the past, accomplished what was apparently of importance, measured by
this standard will arouse little interest, because their artistic speech, depending
on a foundation of the established canonical works of old, is not their
own but borrowed. In others, on the contrary, who, apart from the dominating
tendency, had the courage rather to be insignificant, and yet remain themselves,
observing with their own eyes nature which surrounded them, or
naïvely abandoning themselves to the disposition of their artistic fantasy,
in them will be seen the essential vehicles of the modern spirit. And then
it will be apparent that the art of the nineteenth century as well as that of
every earlier period had its peculiar garment, even if for official occasions
it preferred to unpack from its wardrobe the state costumes of earlier ages.
It is only because this distinction between the eclectic and the personal, the
derived and the independent, has not yet been carried out with sufficient
strictness, that it has hitherto, in my opinion, been found so difficult to discover
the distinctive <i>style</i> of modern art, and to make clear the logic and
sequence of its evolution.</p>

<p class="center chap2">COMMENCEMENT OF MODERN ART IN ENGLAND</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">If</span> the question arises, why modern art has been compelled to find expression
for itself in a form different from that of the art of the earlier centuries,
we must first call attention to the change that has taken place in the
fundamental conditions of society. Formerly, the chief supporters of art
were the two leading powers of Church and King. The most noted works
of Raphael and Michael Angelo, of Velasquez and Murillo, of Rubens and Van
Dyck, were executed either for the churches or for the reigning princes of
their country. The patron of modern art is the citizen. The old culture
of the clerics and aristocrats has been superseded by that of the middle
classes, and the beginnings of modern art must therefore be sought in the
country in which this class first developed its distinctive character&mdash;in England.</p>

<p>England, as early as the eighteenth century, was already a land of citizens.
At a time when there was to be found on the Continent acute mockery of
what was old and outworn, conjoined with the most enthusiastic and joyous
faith in the future, the great and wealthy England had established herself
in the van of the new age. Here Voltaire saw with astonishment for the
first time, when he arrived in London as an exile at the age of thirty-two,
the free, open life of a great people; here he learnt to know a country where
there is &ldquo;much difference of rank, but none that is not based on merit; where
one could think freely without being restrained by slavish terror.&rdquo; Here
was the idea of a modern free state already accomplished at a time when,
upon the Continent, the thunderclouds of the impending storm hardly
cast their first shadow. Here the notion of a united family life had first
developed, upon the foundation of a civil order and security. Here, therefore,
were first broken down those barriers around the territory of literature
and art within which the spirit of the Renaissance had raised its wonderful
flowers, and the road was begun along which the nineteenth century should
advance.</p>

<p>Simultaneously with the growth of the middle classes there arose the
need for a domestic, practical literature. Books were required which people
could read by their fireside, in the seclusion of the family circle, in country
districts. For that, the stiff and antiquated poetry of courtiers and academicians,
which had hitherto been poured out upon the world from France,
was hardly suitable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>10</span></p>

<p>To the cold Classicism represented by Pope, there succeeded in
English literature&mdash;far earlier than was the case elsewhere&mdash;the delineation
of what was immediately contemporary. At the same time that Mdlle. de
Scudéry&mdash;when it was a question of describing the court of the
Great King, the society of Louis <span class="sc">XIV</span>&mdash;felt herself bound to translate
her theme into the antique and write a <i>Cyrus</i>, the English novel had taken
its motives from actual life. Defoe&rsquo;s <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> is the first book in
which man and nature are depicted without the introduction of antique
types or fairies; the first novel in which the details of real life are displayed,
and what had been hitherto neglected is granted an exact delineation. At
a time when people in other countries were occupied with representations
of the antique, the English novelists had embarked on the intimacy of the
family circle. After Richardson, who laboriously yet with animation
described everyday life, followed Fielding, with his sharp observation, homely
and humorous; then Goldsmith, with his serene outlook of untroubled
equanimity, his unsurpassed miniatures; Smollett, with his crude and
satirical character sketching; and the audacious and witty Laurence Sterne,
whom Nietzsche has called the most &ldquo;gallant&rdquo; of all authors. At the same
time tragedy, too, descended from the court and the nobility into the sphere
of domestic life; showing that here too were significant fortunes and conflicts,
which stories strike a truer human note than those of kings and heroes.</p>

<p>Painting moved along the same road; and whilst in other countries,
with the beginning of the century, the high, aristocratic art, which was the
offspring of the Renaissance, gradually waned, the plebeian paintings of
Hogarth laid the foundations of that art which prevailed in the <i>bourgeois</i>
nineteenth century. English art had this advantage in playing a pioneering
part, that it had no old traditions to stand in its way; it had no great past.
In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries England had been content to
offer hospitality to Holbein and Van Dyck, and to collect the works of foreign
masters in her galleries. Her art sprang into existence suddenly and unexpectedly
at the beginning of the eighteenth century, and thence developed
exclusively on native lines. Since the English could not lean either upon
an old or a foreign model, nor enter into a round of subjects that had already
been brought to perfection, they turned from the outset quite naturally
into the road which was only to be trodden later by the other nations still
in the bondage of tradition. They took up, to a certain extent, the thread
which the Dutch, who appeared in the seventeenth century as the most
modern people in art, had let drop: the progressive ideas of Holland had
come over to England with the &ldquo;glorious revolution,&rdquo; with William of Orange
and Queen Anne; whilst in Holland itself the French invasion of 1672 had
caused a reaction to the courtly idea, against which the English took up an
attitude of conscious and rigid protest. This opposition is clearly expressed
by the English æsthetic writers.</p>

<p>The most important name to be mentioned is that of Shaftesbury.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>11</span>
Beneath the favour of the court in France, he says, art has suffered. We
Englishmen live in an age in which freedom has arisen. Such a people does
not require, in order that art may prosper, an ambitious king to breed, by
means of his pensions, a race of flattering Court painters. Our civil liberty
affords us a sufficient foundation, and our liberty leads us to <i>absolute
verity</i> in art.</p>

<p>Thus did Shaftesbury enunciate his leading æsthetic doctrine; it was
his constant message, and it was constantly repeated with great emphasis:
&ldquo;All beauty is truth.&rdquo; &ldquo;The search after truth leads you to nature.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Truth is the mightiest thing in the world, since it exercises sovereign rights
over the creations of the imagination.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But what must art be in order to produce truth? &ldquo;The strictest imitation
of nature.&rdquo; By this word Shaftesbury does not understand what we
understand by the word &ldquo;nature&rdquo;; not, in the first instance, so much the
nature surrounding us, in its outward manifestations, but, above all, an
intimate human reality. Let the painter represent the reality of human
<i>inwardness</i>. Still life, the animal world, landscape,&mdash;all that, Shaftesbury
explains, is most valuable. But another and a higher life exists in man
than in the beasts and the woods, and there is the true object of art. In
no case should the artist proceed from external vision; for then he will obtain
fashionable attitudes, theatrical unreality, or, in the most favourable instance,
a formal, decorative embellishment. Of what value is that in comparison
with a single real presentation of character? How insignificant
would every external form seem in contrast to each single feature of this
intimate manner! Here is the second characteristic of English painting.
It proceeds neither, like that of the sixteenth century, from formulas,
nor, like the Dutch, from the picturesque, but, like to the English
novel of character, from an intellectual impulse; it strives not after beauty
of form and physical, sensuous grace, but, in the first place, after intellectual
expression.</p>

<p>And from this there follows immediately a third trait. If art is to make
the inwardness of man its subject, the artist cannot remain an indifferent
portrayer. He will make great distinctions, will bring into prominence
what is meritorious or censurable in every character&mdash;he will become a
moralist. Only so can he conform to that last and highest function which
Shaftesbury assigns to the painter.</p>

<p>The liberty which the English nation had fought for in the &ldquo;glorious
Revolution&rdquo; brought forth, in the course of years, while Shaftesbury was
writing, a fruitful crop of dissoluteness and licence. The mortification of the
flesh of the Puritans was followed by so violent a recrudescence of sensuality
that it was as though the whole menagerie of the passions had been unchained.
London swarmed with criminals; drunkenness was an epidemic. The
moral idea awoke amongst the cultivated classes. Might it not be possible,
with the help of education, for that to be overcome? And so Shaftesbury&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>12</span>
view of art comprised a third, and very dangerous, element; namely, that to
fulfil the most serious mission of that culture which had ensued from the
free and natural conditions in England&mdash;even in the realm of æsthetics&mdash;the
painter, like the
poet, must appear as the
moral teacher of his age.
Imagine an artist who fulfils
these conditions and you
have, as a result, <i>Hogarth</i>,
with all his qualities and
defects.</p>

<p>What marks the greatness
of Hogarth is his freedom
from foreign and ancient influences.
The eighteenth century
came in as an academic
age in art. Turning away
from life, it spent itself in
allegory and the imitation of
typical figures that had been
inherited from the Renaissance
and petrified into academic
work. Gods, in whom
no one any longer believed,
hovered, at least in paint,
over a race which was without
enthusiasm. Then came
Hogarth, and his quick
vision discovered the new way. He looked out upon the life surrounding
him, with its manifold idiosyncrasies, and felt himself with pride to be
the son of a new age, in which rigid, conventional forms were everywhere
penetrated by the modern ideas of free thought, the rights of man, conformity
to nature in morals and manners. This world which confronted him
he depicted truly as it was, in all its beauty and its ugliness. With him
was the origin of modern art. Before his paintings and engravings pale
idealism disappeared. It was he who resolved and set out to bring into
the world a new and independent observation of life. He was a painter
who, with as little aid from foreign influences as from those of the past,
went his own way and kept to it, and devoted his art, unblemished by
the pallor of a borrowed ideal of beauty, soberly and exclusively to the
realities of surrounding life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seemed to me unlikely,&rdquo; writes he, &ldquo;that by copying old compositions
I could acquire facility for those new designs which were my first and greatest
ambitions.&rdquo; Works of old Italian masters, artistic contemplations, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>13</span>
went back to Raphael and the Caracci, were ignored and ridiculed by him.
His rude strength of painting, directed to the living truth, was a protest
against all that idealism which was the heritage of the Renaissance, and had
grown quite bombastic under the hands of its imitators. Nature, he writes,
is simple, plain, and true in all her works; and with this principle he has
founded a strong English school on the solid foundation of truth to nature.</p>

<p>An Englishman by birth, character, and disposition, he depicted his
fellow-countrymen; he made his sketches in the midst of the hubbub of
the street. His world is London, the world-city, &ldquo;old merry England,&rdquo;
which, in contrast with the Puritanism of to-day, still lived through its golden
age of riot. In such a world&mdash;a world existing to this day, only more decently
berouged&mdash;moved Hogarth; in the company of wine-bibbers, in gambling hells,
in rooms of poets, in cellars of highwaymen, in the death-chambers of fallen
maidens. &ldquo;The Harlot&rsquo;s Progress,&rdquo; which he produced in a series of pictures,
brought him his first success. He then published further series of similar
careers over crooked courses&mdash;&ldquo;The Rake&rsquo;s Progress,&rdquo; &ldquo;Marriage à la Mode.&rdquo;
He painted the rabble of London, their society and their morals; those who
went in cotton and rags and those in satin and silk. In his writings he censures
the old painters plainly because in their historical style they had quite passed
over the middle classes. And he went with great knowledge to these new
subjects. In the National Gallery, which possesses the originals of &ldquo;Marriage
à la Mode,&rdquo; one is astounded at the technical qualities of Hogarth&rsquo;s painting.
Whoever has been misled by the engraved reproductions, and looks for bad,
distorted drawing, may here learn to know him as a painter in the fullest
sense of the
word. There
is no sign left
of the defective
caricature which
disfigures the
engravings;
there is a severe,
unadorned
manifestation of
realism, of an
art that has
from the outset
rooted itself in
modern life.
Under the manners
and graces
of the age
Hogarth stands
a &ldquo;self-made&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>14</span>
man, a healthy Anglo-Saxon personality, full of sturdy independence and
impeccable common sense. He attracts by a sharpness of observation, a
penetration into idiosyncrasies of character, a grip upon the most trivial
changes in men&rsquo;s
emotions and
play of features,
the like of which
is to be found
in hardly one of
his predecessors.</p>

<table class="flt" style="float: right; width: 570px;" summary="Illustration">

<p>Against these
qualities it must
be understood
that an equal
number of defects
is to be
set off. The
inartistic part of
him was that he
followed the
æsthetic theories
of the age, and
looked upon art
as merely a means to ends alien to itself. With him painting was an
instrument to disseminate the inventions of his poetic-satiric humour; it
was a form of speech to him. He is not unjustly called on that account a
comedian of the pencil, the Molière of painting. We look at other pictures,
but his we read. The commentaries on them are in some respects the
rendering back of the pictures into their proper element. Lessing called
the drama his pulpit; with Hogarth his art was a pulpit. He wanted, like
Hamlet, to &ldquo;hold the mirror up to nature, to show virtue her own feature,
scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time his form and
pressure.&rdquo; Pictures beneath his hands became moral sermons.</p>

<p>In the six pictures in &ldquo;The Harlot&rsquo;s Progress,&rdquo; with which he started
in 1733, and which to-day, since the originals have perished, can be considered
only in the copper engravings after them, all these attributes are recognisable.
Mary Hackabout comes innocent from the country to the town
with the intention of seeking a situation as a servant-girl. She speedily
falls a victim to temptation, becomes the mistress of a Jewish banker, whom
she soon loses by her infidelity, descends to be a thief, and comes to the work-house.
Released from there, she becomes the companion of a highwayman,
until she ends her pitiful life in a disorderly house, leaving behind her a poor
crippled boy, who, at his mother&rsquo;s funeral, is playing with a top. The conclusion
of the paintings shows how the other women bid farewell to the corpse,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>15</span>
and buoy themselves up for their coming pleasures by drinking from the
spirit bottle, which stands on the coffin, while the priest, who is come to

<p>The second series, which is to be seen to-day in the Soane Museum,
describes in eight tableaux the somewhat similar life of a young man, the
&ldquo;Rake.&rdquo; As an Oxford student he has promised marriage to a pretty but
poor girl, when suddenly the death of a wealthy uncle throws him into the
vortex of London life. He wishes to buy himself freedom from his sweetheart,
but she disdainfully refuses the money and supports herself and her
child honestly with the labour of her hands. The seducer, winning fame
in the world of women and sport, rapidly paces the road to ruin; yet he
repairs his finances once again by a marriage with a rich and one-eyed old
lady. Once more on his feet, he flings himself into games of chance, and
comes to the sponging-house, whither his better half follows him. It is
the last straw when a play which he has offered to a manager is refused, and
he can no longer buy himself a pint of ale; there remains only the final fall
into the misery of frenzy, and in the last picture we find him amongst the
lunatics bound in chains as a madman. Only his student love, Sarah Young,
of Oxford, whom he had treated so scurvily, cannot forget him, and, with
tears, seeks him out again in the madhouse.</p>

<p>The third and most famous series was completed many years after the
&ldquo;Rake&rdquo;&mdash;in 1745. Hogarth has admittedly taken particular pains with
the six oil paintings of &ldquo;Marriage à la Mode,&rdquo; which have been placed in the
National Gallery; and these painted novels reveal in strength and beauty
of execution the
high-water mark
of his work as a
painter. The
whole is quieter,
simpler, less overloaded
with ingenious
accessories.
The impoverished
lord
has married his
son, who is already
worn out with
excesses, to the
strong and healthy
daughter of a city
alderman. A girl
is born; then they
go their separate
ways. The husband
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>16</span>
surprises the wife with a lover, and is stabbed by him; the
unfaithful wife, moved by this, begs her dying husband for forgiveness.
As a young widow, deprived of her woman&rsquo;s honour, she goes back
to the <i>bourgeois</i>, Philistine ennui of her father&rsquo;s house, and when she learns of
her lover&rsquo;s condemnation she escapes from the burden of her misery by means
of poison. The father is sufficiently provident to take the wedding ring off her
finger before the body is cold, lest it should be stolen from the corpse. In the
last sequence Hogarth passed over completely to the moral sermon and the
study of crime. The series &ldquo;Industry and Idleness,&rdquo; in 1747, was comprised
in twelve sheets, which he produced only in rough engravings, as he wished
exclusively to influence the masses. Two apprentices enter a cloth-weaving
business at the same time, of whom one rises, through his zeal for the interests
of the business, to a marriage with his master&rsquo;s beautiful daughter, to the rank
of alderman, and finally to be Lord Mayor of London. The idle apprentice
grows, on the down grade, from a gambler into a vagabond. He is transported,
comes back again, and ends on the scaffold. The two comrades meet
for the last time when the honest man announces his death-warrant to the
knave.</p>

<p class="noind">Hogarth painted stirring and humorous scenes, full of effective morality,
with which he sought to cheer, terrify, and improve humanity. His five-act
tragedies end always with the triumph of Virtue and the punishment of Vice.
As one of his contemporaries said, he exercised the art of &ldquo;hanging in colours.&rdquo;
The twelve plates of the parallel biographies of &ldquo;Industry and Idleness&rdquo;
he employed as an illustrated weekly sermon for the benefit of the working
classes, and he was able to observe with satisfaction that they had an actual
influence on the conduct of the people, as instanced in the diminution of gin
shops. Yet for all that, in the elevation of public morality, the highest aim of
art is not, as Garrick asserted, fulfilled. Who has ever seen such a painter?
Would he be a painter? It is exactly by this moralising with the brush that
Hogarth stands in such abrupt opposition to his predecessors, the Dutch.
They were painters, nothing but painters, and in their painting reckoned on
eyes which could appreciate their pictorial subtilty. Man was for them a patch
of colour; the real delight of their eyes was the rich light that came mellowed
through the shadows, and played upon the ruffed garments and the clumsy
forms. With Hogarth, in the place of the idea of colour, the anecdote is
brought in. He saw the world not so much with the eyes of the painter,
as with those of the physician, the criminologist, the pastor. The familiar
element, that serene and comfortable observation of an everyday occurrence
upon which Dutch art was based, has altogether disappeared in his pictures.
He did not paint because something pictorial urged him, but saw in men the
actors of the parts which he had in his mind. This departure from the purely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>18</span>
picturesque is in part explained by the predominance of literature in England
at that time. In a country where the tragedy of familiar life as well as the
domestic novel had arisen there was imminent peril that a young school
of painting working
without traditions
should
branch off also
on to those lines.
Hogarth desired
to give painting a
new manner; he
seized upon what
was epic or dramatic,
and painted
the pictorial counter
parts to Smollett&rsquo;s
and Richardson&rsquo;s
novels. In
the age of enlightenment
the painter
makes way for the
writer. With this
idea he himself
wrote: &ldquo;I have endeavoured to treat my subjects as a dramatic writer;
my picture is my stage, my men and women my players, who, by means
of certain actions and gestures, are to exhibit a dumb show.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moreover, to explain the growth of this sort of literary hybrid, one is
forced to consider the changed conditions under which painting was introduced
into England at large. Art, which hitherto had shone forth her
enchantment upon the few, was conducted from the first in free England
along the broad road of popularity, and given over to a public which had
to be educated to art by degrees; and this admission of the mass of the
people to the enjoyment of art, in a proportion hitherto unheard of,
must inevitably have a retrogressive effect upon painting itself. Instead of
the earlier amateur of really distinguished culture, there stood &ldquo;the People.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But just as in the Middle Ages works of art were seen to be a sort of picture-writing
for the people&mdash;<i>picturis eruditur populus</i>, said Gregory the Great,&mdash;so
now the new patrons could hardly require other than those works of art
in which a story was pictorially told. These could be understood even by
the man whose understanding was otherwise wholly closed to matters of
art; and hence it came about that almost all the <i>genre</i> painters&mdash;for very
nearly a century&mdash;followed with more or less intelligence in the footsteps
of Hogarth. To treat him, as is frequently done, because of this popularisation
of art, because of this transformation of the picture into the picture
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>19</span>
story, as a pattern instance of tastelessness, would lead to very dangerous
consequences, and should be the less employed because Hogarth&rsquo;s pictures
are, at least, comparatively well painted, whereas many of his successors
could escape the deluge only in the Noah&rsquo;s Ark of their talent for narration.
What Hogarth could do when he put off the schoolmaster, he has shown
moreover in his portraits. There he is an entirely great painter. His
pictures have none of that Van Dyck elegance, which had become the mode
in England before him; they are robust, crude, Anglo-Saxon, strongly and
broadly painted withal, sketches, in the best sense of the word. His &ldquo;Shrimp
Girl,&rdquo; in the National Gallery, for instance, is a masterpiece to which the
nineteenth century can hardly produce a rival.</p>

<p>In the history of painting it is notorious that the latter half of the last
century belongs especially to portraiture, and here the English occupy the
first rank. Neither Hogarth nor Reynolds nor Gainsborough was a genius
like Titian, Velasquez, or even Frans Hals. Their art is not to be compared
with that of the greatest of all portrait painters, but they surpassed all the
painters of the eighteenth century; they were not only the greatest in England
since Van Dyck, but the first portrait painters in Europe at the time.</p>

<p>Reynolds and Gainsborough lived almost at the same period. The former,
born in 1723, died in 1792; the latter, born in 1727, died in 1788. They had
as models men and women of the same society. They went the same road,
side by side. Many celebrities strayed from one studio to the other, and
were painted by Reynolds as
well as by Gainsborough.
These are just the pictures
which show us so distinctly
how widely the two, who
were usually mentioned in
the same breath, differed
from each other in spite of
having grown up on the same
soil. Even their outward man
displays this dissimilarity.</p>

<p>Reynolds appears in his
&ldquo;Portrait of Himself&rdquo; in the
Uffizzi Gallery at Florence, in
the red mantle of the President
of the Academy, the official
cap on his head, while the
hand resting on the table
holds a copy of his <i>Discourses</i>;
close by is a bust
of Michael Angelo. The complexion
is that of a man who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>20</span>
sits much within doors. A pair of spectacles with large, round glasses leads
one to conclude that he injured his eyesight early with much reading.
Gainsborough, with his refined Roman nose, the haughty, curved sensuous
lips, and the expression of his face
which speaks at once of innocence
and refinement, gives an impression
far more than Reynolds of the child
of nature and the gentleman. His
cheeks are fresh and rather ruddy;
a depth of soul lies within the large
blue eyes, that are somewhat
melancholy, yet have such a free
outlook upon life.</p>

<p><i>Joshua Reynolds&rsquo;</i> father was a
clergyman, a most learned man, who
kept a Latin school. He gave the
boy, it is recorded, that most uncommon
Christian name, for the
remarkable reason that he hoped
thereby to draw the attention of a
great personage, who bore the same
name, towards his young namesake.
His son was to become a physician.
But books on other subjects which he read at his desk at school made a
greater impression on the boy. In the well known <i>Treatise on Painting</i>, by
Richardson, he discovered his vocation. From the perusal of this book he
developed a taste for things artistic, studied the works on perspective of
Pater Pozzo, read everything he could find on art, and copied as a
preliminary all that fell into his hands in the way of woodcuts and
copper engravings. One of the earliest drawings which remain from his
childhood represents the interior of a library. At the age of nineteen he
came to London to a well-known master, Hudson, the favourite painter
with the gentry of the day, who required £120 with a pupil. He was already
convinced that only in London could he find the means to attain fame, and
even as early as 1744 he took a fine establishment and kept open house in
order to attract attention. He was soon in a position to complete his artistic
education by means of residence in Italy. In 1746 he had painted the portrait
of a Captain Keppel, who shortly afterwards was appointed Commodore
of the Mediterranean squadron, and invited the young painter to go for a cruise
in his ship. They sailed in 1749, and Reynolds was able to spend three years
in Italy.</p>

<p>His first impression was one of bitter disappointment. Where was that
rich colouring in the Italian classics which he had been led to expect from
English mezzotints? Everything struck him as lifeless, pale, insipid. Whereupon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>21</span>
he affected the opinion that there was no more to be seen in Rome.
Raphael, in particular, appeared to him to be a mediocre painter, whom
only a remarkable chance had brought to such a pitch of fame. Surrounded
by the great masterpieces of the Cinquecento, he employed himself in drawing
caricatures, and made a sort of travesty of the <i>School of Athens</i>, in which he
drew caricatures of the English colony in Rome at that time, in the attitudes
of figures in the pictures of Raphael. But he very speedily changed his
opinion, and began to follow the paths of the great dead. He went indefatigably
through the galleries of Rome, from Rubens to Titian, from Correggio to
Guido and Raphael. He studied so hard in the Vatican, that he took a chill
in the cold rooms, which left him all his life a little deaf. That sojourn at
Rome was to Reynolds what, a hundred years later, his visit to Spain was
to Lenbach.</p>

<p>He had already at Hudson&rsquo;s acquired great facility as a copyist, and of
Guercino, in particular, he had made numerous copies. During this Italian
tour, however, he became the greatest connoisseur of old masters that the
eighteenth century possessed.</p>

<p>It is related that the Chevalier Van Loo, when he was in England in 1763,
vaunted himself one day, in Reynolds&rsquo; presence, upon his unfailing discrimination
in telling a copy from an original. Whereupon Reynolds showed
him one of his own studies of a head, after Rembrandt. The Chevalier judged
it to be, indisputably, a masterpiece by the great Dutchman.</p>

<p>He left Rome in April 1752,
and made a further visit to Naples,
to the cities of Tuscany, and to
Venice. The careless notes of
travel that he made on this
journey show the clear insight
which he had attained into the
Italian schools. They all deal
with questions of technique, on
effects of light and shadow, on
the mystery of <i>chiaroscuro</i>. For
Titian, in particular, he had an
extravagant devotion,&mdash;he would
ruin himself, he said, if he might
only possess one of the great
works of Titian.</p>

<p>When he returned to England
in 1752, at the age of thirty, his
talent was fully developed, and
the connoisseurs were unanimous
in hailing him as a new Van
Dyck. With the portrait of Miss
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>22</span>
Gunning, afterwards the Duchess of Hamilton, he appeared in 1753
as a power in English art. As early as 1755, when Hogarth was compelled
to give up portrait painting for lack of patrons, one hundred and twenty-five
persons sat for Reynolds, and
after that about one hundred and
fifty people were painted by him
annually; and this brought him in a
yearly income of about £16,000.</p>

<table class="flt" style="float: left; width: 380px;" summary="Illustration">

<p>At first he took up his quarters
in St. Martin&rsquo;s Lane, which was
then the most fashionable place of
residence for artists; but in 1760
he bought a house, No. 47 Leicester
Square, the most select quarter of
London, and furnished it with the
most palatial splendour. The studio,
which he built for himself, was as
large as a ballroom, and furnished
with a quite modern luxury. The
large corridor that led to it had a
gallery of pictures by old masters.
It was the age of the great literary
and dramatic revival in England.
Garrick stood at the zenith of his
popularity, Burke had already made
himself a name, Johnson had produced
his <i>Dictionary</i>, Richardson had reached the summit of his fame, Smollett had
written <i>Peregrine Pickle</i>, Gray had attracted notice by his verse. All these
and others who set the vogue in literature and the drama, the principal
figures in politics, the leaders of fashion, lounged in that luxurious studio
and gossiped with Reynolds of the theatre, both before and behind
the scenes, of the doings in Parliament and the scandal of the Court,
of literature and of art. At the time when Goldsmith was putting
the finishing touches to his <i>Travels</i> he was a guest of the house. Gibbon,
the historian, and Sterne, whose <i>Sentimental Journey</i> was just then the
talk of the town, spent their vacant hours with him; and Burke as well,
while he discussed with him his treatise on the <i>Sublime and the Beautiful</i>.
All these claimed a niche in Reynolds&rsquo; portrait gallery, where all the talents
were met together. The whole English nobility also flocked to him. For
forty years onwards from 1752 it was considered the proper thing to be
painted by him. His pictures were multiplied immediately at the hands of the
engravers. In the complete catalogue of Reynolds&rsquo; works, Hamilton counts,
so far back as 1820, no fewer than 675 plates, engraved after Reynolds by
more than a hundred artists, and amongst these the mezzotints of Samuel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>23</span>
Cousins are by far the finest. Only an incredible industry, enabling him
for a long succession of years to paint almost without intermission with a
facility and regularity like that of Rubens, rendered it possible for Reynolds
to complete, exclusive of portraits, quite a number of religious and mythological
pictures, of which he himself was especially proud. He painted with
great speed and dexterity, rose very early, breakfasted at nine o&rsquo;clock, was in his
studio punctually at ten; and there till eleven he worked on pictures which
had been commenced. On the stroke of eleven the first sitter arrived, who
was succeeded by another an hour later. Thus he painted till four o&rsquo;clock,
when he made his toilette, and thenceforward belonged to society, for
in spite of his scholarly temperament one can by no means consider
Reynolds as a solitary eccentric. Although he remained a bachelor
after Angelica Kauffmann had declined his hand, his house was a central
gathering-point for noble London. He gave balls to which the whole of
&ldquo;Society&rdquo; was invited, and drove in a magnificent carriage, with coachmen
in blue and silver liveries. The Literary Club was founded at his instigation,
where with Johnson, Burke, Goldsmith, Gibbon, and Garrick he shared in
conversation both profound and brilliant. He was made a baronet, and
when the Royal Academy was founded in 1768, became its first president.
The dinners of the Academy, which he organised at the distribution of prizes,
play a part in the history of English cookery. Reynolds had promised that
on each of these reunions he
would speak on some question
of art. In this manner originated,
during his twenty-three
years of office, those fifteen
discourses upon painting
which show the highest result
of his literary energy. They
were not his maiden essays.
As far back as 1758 Johnson
had invited him to publish
an article upon Art in a
journal which he had founded,
<i>The Idler</i>. In 1781 he made a
journey through Holland and
Flanders, upon which, anticipating
Fromentin, he wrote an
exceedingly fine book. In
his <i>Discourses</i> so high a
degree of literary talent was
displayed that they were at
one time said to be the work
of Johnson or Burke.</p>

<p>They are æsthetic treatises and essays in the history of art, of an enduring
value. Originating from a vast insight, and expressed in a precise style,
they treat of the laws of classic art, the variation in styles, the causes of
the finest bloom in art. Certainly
eclecticism is preached too. The
modern artist, it is declared, can
only stand on the shoulders of his
forebears. The great Italians must be
his models, and of these the greatest
is Michael Angelo. His last essay
closes with these words: &ldquo;I reflect,
not without vanity, that these discourses
bear testimony of my admiration
of that truly divine man, and
I should desire that the last words
which I should pronounce in this
Academy, and from this place, might
be the name of Michael Angelo.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When he died, his friend Edmund
Burke wrote in the funeral oration
which he dedicated to him: &ldquo;Sir
Joshua Reynolds was, on many
accounts, one of the most memorable
men of his time. He was the first
Englishman who added the praise of
the elegant arts to the other glories
of his country. In taste, in grace, in facility, in happy invention, and in
the richness and harmony of colouring, he was equal to the greatest masters
of the renowned ages.... In full affluence of foreign and domestic fame,
admired by the expert in art and by the learned in science, courted by
the great, caressed by sovereign powers and celebrated by distinguished
poets, ... the loss of no man of his time can be felt with more sincere,
general, and unmixed sorrow.&rdquo; He was buried with great pomp in
St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral. The pictures left unfinished at his death
fetched at auction £37,000; the whole fortune which he left is estimated
at £80,000.</p>

<p>The biography of <i>Thomas Gainsborough</i> reads quite differently.</p>

<p>The traveller who rides from London to Birmingham passes through
some of the fairest scenery in the island. He finds himself in the heart of
fresh and tender English nature. Small rivulets flow through the gently
undulating country. Wide meadows clothe the soft hollows in the valleys
with abundant green. In grassy enclosures deer and roes are feeding; they
push forwards inquisitively as the train passes. Fragrant linden trees rise
dreamily in the suave, park-like landscape, through which the Stour winds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>25</span>
along like a riband of silver. On the bank of this enchanting stream Thomas
Gainsborough, the son of a simple clothier, was born. Reynolds&rsquo; vocation
had been brought about through the perusal of a book. In the scenery
and the woods that were in the neighbourhood of his home, Gainsborough,
who was so alive to all the beauty of nature, received the decisive impression
of his life. Here he roamed as a boy, while he neglected his school lessons.
&ldquo;Tom will be hung some day,&rdquo; reflected his schoolmaster; &ldquo;Tom will be
a genius,&rdquo; thought his parents. He sketched the parks and castles of the
neighbourhood. In his later life he used to say that there was no picturesque
old tree trunk, no meadow or woodland glade or stream within a four-mile
radius of Sudbury, that he did not retain a recollection of from his childish
years. Like Constable, when he was an old man, he still thought with gratitude
of his home, of all that beauty upon which he had looked, and which had
made him a painter. Here, in the green woods and fresh pastures of his
birthplace, he trained himself. At the age of ten he was a painter.</p>

<p>A sojourn of four years in London seems to have added little to his ability.
Elegant in his manners, lively in his conversation, a born gentleman, he
might have become completely the man of fashion. But he was far too diffident,
with his naïve simplicity, to force himself amongst the stars of the
world of art in London, far too distinguished and retiring to join in the race
after the favour of the public, and so at the age of eighteen he returned to
his native place with the unencouraging prospect of playing the part of a
simple painter in the provinces.
First and last, the woods remained
his chief delight. One
morning, as he was painting
there, he looked up from his
easel and saw a young and
beautiful girl in a light summer
dress, peeping coquettishly from
behind the trunk of a tree. She
blushed, he spoke to her shyly.
Soon afterwards Margaret Burr
became his wife, and the whole
history of his life with her remains
a charming idyll, like the spring
morning on which he made her
acquaintance. Married at the
age of nineteen, he installed
himself at Ipswich, his wife&rsquo;s
native place, and there he spent
fifteen years in great happiness,
firm in the conviction that he
would end his days there. There
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>26</span>
he painted his first portraits, which, from 1761, were forwarded by a carrier&rsquo;s
cart to London for exhibition in the Royal Academy. From Ipswich he
went to Bath, the fashionable watering-place, where he painted the visitors
who came in the summer for the
cure. Finally, in the end his portraits
met with approval in London. That
gave him courage in 1764 to proceed
thither himself; and there he took
very modest rooms. On his arrival
he was as yet very little known; he
came from the provinces, which he
had till then never left, at a time when
Reynolds stood at the pinnacle of his
fame, and had visited Italy and Spain.
Yet he gradually won a reputation.
Franklin was one of the first
to sit to him. Soon he became the
favourite painter of the king and the
royal family. George <span class="sc">III</span> was painted
eight times by him, Pitt seven times,
Garrick five. Lord Chancellor Camden,
Sir William Blackstone, Johnson,
Laurence Sterne, Richardson, Burke,
Sheridan, Mrs. Graham, Lady Montagu,
Mrs. Siddons, Lady Vernon, Lady Maynard, and the names of many other
celebrities and beauties are bound up with his. His life-work, excluding
sketches, consists of no more than three hundred pictures, of which two
hundred and twenty are portraits&mdash;a very small number in comparison with
the four thousand paintings of Joshua Reynolds. Thomas Gainsborough
painted irregularly. Even when he was in his studio he might be seen
standing for hours gazing out of his window dreamily at the grass. In other
features of his life too he was equally different from Reynolds: unaccountably,
he was one moment a brilliant, animated companion, the next plunged in
melancholy. He dreamed much, while Reynolds painted and wrote. In
the evenings he usually sat at home with his dear little wife, completed no
treatises or discourses on his art, but made sketches or sometimes music.
Reynolds was a scholar-painter, Gainsborough a painter-musician. It was
said of him that he painted portraits for money and landscapes for amusement,
but that he made music because he needs must. He collected
musical instruments as Reynolds did a library. Even in his pictures he
gives his people, for preference, violins in their hands. To the Musical Club
which he had founded in Ipswich he remained faithful all his life, and in
that neighbourhood, or in Richmond or Hampstead, he spent the summer
every year. Here amidst that green nature it was also his wish to be buried.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>27</span>
His funeral was a very quiet one. In the peaceful graveyard at Kew,
Thomas Gainsborough sleeps tranquilly under the shady willows, far from
the noise and tumult of the great city. Sir Joshua said at his grave:
&ldquo;Should England ever become so fruitful in talent that we can venture to
speak of an English school, then will Gainsborough&rsquo;s name be handed down
to posterity as one of the first.&rdquo; Yes, one might say to-day, as the first of all.</p>

<p>Joshua Reynolds is certainly a great painter, and deserves the high veneration
in which his compatriots hold him. It is not without a certain awe
that, in the Diploma Gallery of the Royal Academy, one can look upon the armchair
that he used during his sittings, upon which all who were famous in
eighteenth-century England have sat. Reynolds is one of the greatest English
portrait painters, and, resembling most the classical masters, showed in
the highest degree the qualities we admire in them. His colouring is of an
amazing softness, depth, and strength; his <i>chiaroscuro</i> is warm and vaporous.
There are portraits by him which, in the subtlety of their tone, resemble the
best of Rembrandt&rsquo;s; others, whose noble colouring approaches the <i>chef-d&rsquo;&oelig;uvres</i>
of Van Dyck. Master of the whole mechanism of the human body,
he possessed in the highest degree the rare art of setting persons surely and
unconstrainedly on their feet. His portraits are pictures; one needs no
whit to be acquainted with the persons they represent; they satisfy as works
of art in themselves, and as psychological studies by a man who had the
capacity of sounding the
depths of the human heart.
The complete catalogue of all
those who sat for Sir Joshua
during the space of half a
century forms an uninterrupted
commentary on the
contemporary history of England.</p>

<p>There we see the skilful
portrait of Sterne, with his
look of witty mockery; the
marvellous Bohemian, Oliver
Goldsmith, who even then
had the manuscript of his
<i>Vicar of Wakefield</i> in his
pocket; Johnson, who, in
one, sits at his writing-table,
on which stands an ink-pot
and a volume of his <i>English
Dictionary</i>, and in another is
peering into a book with
his short-sighted eyes screwed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>28</span>
up tightly, and his whole posture awkward and unwieldy. Garrick,
who went from one studio to the other, appears also more than
once in Reynolds&rsquo; portrait gallery. Amongst his portraits of military
dignitaries, that of General Lord
Heathfield, the famous defender of
Gibraltar, whom he painted in full
uniform, is one of the most noticeable.
Strong as a rock he stands
there, with the key of the fortress
in his hand. What a contrast between
these figures and those of
the contemporary French portraits!
There, those friendly and smiling
ministers, those gallant and dainty
ecclesiastics, those scented, graceful
marquises, who move with such
elegant ease about the parquet floor,
and from whose faces a uniform
refinement has erased all the roughness
of individuality; here, expressive,
thoughtful heads, characters
hardened in the school of life, many
of the faces coarse and bloated, the
glance telling of cold resolution, the attitude full of self-reliant dignity and
gnarled, plebeian pride. The same <i>bourgeois</i> element predominates in the
pictures of the ladies. Van Dyck&rsquo;s noble, eminently intellectual figures
always wore the glamour of the Renaissance. In the background an artistically
arranged curtain, a column, or the view of the quiet avenues of some broad
park. From Reynolds we get strong active women in their everyday clothes,
and with thoughtful countenances: good mothers, surrounded by their children,
whom they kiss and enfold in a tender embrace. The idea of half-symbolical
representation has vanished, and in its place is introduced the idea of home
and the family. The pictures of children by this childless old bachelor
were an artistic revelation to the existing generation, and are the delight of
the world of to-day. In other portraits of ladies, that noticeable characteristic
of the English nation, their predilection for domestic animals and for
sport, finds an expression. The beautiful Duchess of Devonshire he painted
as she gently restrained with her finger her little daughter&rsquo;s caresses, which
would fain have disordered her <i>coiffure</i>; a whole gallery of noble ladies he
represented feeding their poultry or petting their lap-dogs; Lady Spencer
in her riding-habit, her whip in her hand, her horse reined in, her cheeks flushed
from her gallop. Nelly O&rsquo;Brien looks an actress, a woman who turned men&rsquo;s
heads, and she does it still to-day in Reynolds&rsquo; picture. There lurks something
enigmatic, perplexing in the smile of this sphinx&mdash;only Monna Lisa
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>29</span>
had such a smile, but Nelly&rsquo;s eyes are deeper, more desirous. One feels that
in the three centuries since Monna Lisa love has taken on a new and subtler
<i>nuance</i>. The portrait of Mrs. Siddons is the most famous of the pictures of
actresses which Reynolds painted, and Mrs. Siddons, of all the women of
that time, is the one whose portrait occupied the painters most. She was
the daughter of Roger Kemble, the actor, and sister of that pretty actress,
Mrs. Twiss, whose portrait by Reynolds (in 1784) we also have, and of the
famous John Philip Kemble, who figures so often in the portrait gallery of
Lawrence, as Hamlet, Cato, Coriolanus, Richard <span class="sc">III</span>, etc. Born to the
boards, as it were, she had, when still a child, joined her parents on their
Thespian pilgrimages, and had had many engagements in the provinces,
at Birmingham, Manchester, and Bath, before she was recruited by the playwright
Sheridan for the Drury Lane company in London. She made her
<i>début</i> there on 10th October 1782, and was hailed forthwith as the greatest
actress of her time. Lady Macbeth was her great part; in that she was
painted both by Romney and Lawrence. Reynolds painted her as the Tragic
Muse. A diadem encircles her hair, she sits upon a throne, the throne rests
upon clouds. Behind her stand two allegorical beings, Crime and Remorse,
two quite unfortunate figures. But the principal figure is truly great, in
its noble, regal attitude, and quite unconstrained in its dramatic pose. Reynolds
had the composition in his mind many weeks before Mrs. Siddons sat
for him in the autumn of 1783. &ldquo;Take your seat upon the throne for
which you were born, and suggest to me the idea of the Tragic Muse.&rdquo; With
these words he conducted her to the pedestal. &ldquo;I made a few steps,&rdquo; the
actress relates, &ldquo;and then took at
once the attitude in which the Tragic
Muse has remained.&rdquo; When the
picture was finished, says Sir Joshua,
gallant as ever: &ldquo;I cannot lose this
opportunity of sending my name to
posterity on the hem of your garment.&rdquo;
And he, who hardly ever
signed his pictures, wrote in large
characters his name and the date on
the gold-embroidered border of the
dress. The original picture has been
in the possession of the Grosvenor
family since 1822; a second copy is
in the gallery at Dulwich.</p>

<p>Reynolds loved to depict his
sitters in mythological or historical
settings. Thus he painted Mrs.
Hartley, her son as a nymph and
the youthful Bacchus, the three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>30</span>
Misses Montgomery as the Three Graces crowning a term of Hymen,
a little girl sitting on the grass as the &ldquo;Age of Innocence,&rdquo; Lady Spencer
as a gipsy telling her brother&rsquo;s fortune, Mrs. Sheridan as St. Cecilia.
The five &ldquo;Heads of Angels,&rdquo; as
they are called, in the National
Gallery, are five different studies
of the lovely child-head of little
Isabella Gordon. Garrick, in
one of his pictures, is set between
the allegorical figures of
Tragedy and Comedy. Reynolds
himself was frankly proud of
these portraits in the mood of
history. He was, as he said, in
general only a portrait painter
because the world required it;
that which he aspired after
was the great manner of historical
painting. Nevertheless,
pictures, such as the &ldquo;Little
Hercules with the Serpent,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Cupid unfastening the Girdle
of Venus,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Death of
Dido,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Forbearance of
Scipio,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Childhood of the
Prophet Samuel,&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Adoration of the Shepherds,&rdquo; do not cause us
to deplore too bitterly that he rarely found time for such mythological
and historical pictures. His <i>putti</i> are derived from Correggio; in the
arrangement of drapery he resembles Guido; in his &ldquo;Venus&rdquo; he is a coarser
Titian. Reynolds&rsquo; own manner in these pictures is merely the eclectic
accumulation of the peculiarities of the old masters&mdash;he brought no new
element into historical painting.</p>

<p>And herein lies his principal weakness. Hogarth declared: &ldquo;There is
only one school, that of nature.&rdquo; Reynolds: &ldquo;There is only one doorway
to the school of nature, and of that the old masters hold the key.&rdquo; The
great men of old were for him the object of constant and conscious thought.
He has endeavoured in his writings to propound a sort of general foundation of
painting, has adopted the principles of the best painters in every land, was indefatigable
in exploring the secrets of the old masterpieces, and has therefore won
the praise of having set the English school, which had hitherto possessed no
perfected tradition of painting, technically on firm feet. He was the founder
of a scientific technique of painting derived from the ancients,&mdash;the Lenbach
of the eighteenth century. Upon the mixture of colours, the gradations
of light and shade, technically and æsthetically, no artist has pondered more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>31</span>
than he, who knew the great Netherlanders, Rubens, Van Dyck, and Rembrandt,
as well as, or better than, his particular favourites, the Italians.
He made experiments all his life long to discover the stone of the
wise Venetians; but he met with the same experience as Lenbach. And
these experiments in the direction of the colour effects of the old masters
were the bane of his pictures&rsquo; durability. It was well said by Walpole:
&ldquo;If Sir Joshua is content with his own blemished pictures, then he is happier
than their possessors, or posterity. According to my view, he ought to be
paid in annual instalments, and only so long as his works last.&rdquo; And Haydon
opined that &ldquo;Reynolds sought by tricks to obtain results which the old
masters attained by the simplest means.&rdquo; He endeavoured by means of
asphaltum to give his pictures the artistic tones of the galleries, with the
result that, to-day, the majority have lost every sign of freshness.</p>

<p>With regard to the pose also, and similar conceptions, one can never
quite get away from the thought of Van Dyck and other old masters. Reynolds&rsquo;
chief endeavour, not only as regards colouring, but also in other respects,
was to resemble the ancients, and this has brought into his pictures something
imitative and laboured. He dearly loved the Romans and
Venetians; we believe to-day that he loved almost too dearly the Bolognese.
And just that fine, artistic education which he received in Italy and Holland,
and the scientific method in which he practised his art, did harm to Reynolds,
and brought into his pictures
too much reminiscence, too
many alien touches. He has in
most cases understood it&mdash;how
to bring into uniformity the
numerous borrowings of his
palette, all that he had taken
from Leonardo, Correggio,
Velasquez, and Rembrandt.
Yet he has never quite forgotten
the old masters and
looked only at his model, for
the sake of the very daintiest
lady or the freshest English
boy. For his children he
thought of Correggio&rsquo;s &ldquo;Cherubim,&rdquo;
for his schoolboys of
Murillo, for the portrait of Mrs.
Hartley of Leonardo da Vinci,
for that of Mrs. Sheridan of
Raphael. There lacked in him
that spontaneity which denotes
the great master. By his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>32</span>
erudition in art, Sir Joshua elevated himself on the shoulders of all who
had preceded him. He obtained thereby the piquant effects in his portraits,
but it was at the price of the penalty that from many of his works it is
rather a rancid odour of oil and
varnish which exhales than the
breath of life.</p>

<p>Gainsborough can certainly not
be compared with Reynolds in the
mass of his work. He was master
neither of his powers of industry
nor of his smooth and brilliant
methods of painting that were always
sure of their effect. In many of his
pictures he gives the impression of a
self-taught man, who sought to help
himself to the best of his power.
Just as little has he the psychological
acuteness of Reynolds. A portrait
painter puts no more into a head
than he has in his own; thus the
acute thinker, Reynolds, was able to
put a great deal into his heads,
whilst Gainsborough, the dreamer,
was often enough quite helpless when he confronted a conspicuously manly
character. In his whole temperament a painter of landscape, before his
model too he sat as before a landscape, with eyes that perceived but did
not analyse. What, with Reynolds, was sought out and understood, was felt
by Gainsborough; and therefore the former is always good and correct, while
Gainsborough is unequal and often faulty, but in his best pictures has a
charm to which those of the President of the Academy never attained. Gainsborough,
too, at his death murmured the name of an old master. &ldquo;We are all
going to Heaven, and Van Dyck is of the company.&rdquo; But what distinguishes
him from Reynolds, and gives him a character of greater originality, is just his
naïve independence of the ancients, which resulted partly from the different
nature of his education in art. Reynolds had lived for two years in Rome
and explored all the principal cities of Italy, had visited Flanders and Holland,
learnt to wonder at Rembrandt, and developed an enthusiasm for <i>chiaroscuro</i>.
Gainsborough in his rural seclusion had been able neither by travel on
the Continent to study the great masters of the past, nor to assimilate the
traditions of the studio. He contented himself with the beauties which
he saw in his native country, studied them in their touching simplicity, without
troubling himself about academic rules. He lived in London until his death,
without once leaving England; and that gives to his pictures a distinct
<i>nuance</i>. The one studied pictures and books, the other only the &ldquo;book
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>33</span>
of nature.&rdquo; His portraits never aim at any external effect, nor are
they raised into the historical; they seek to give no other impression
than that of a quite subjective truth to nature, both in arrangement and
in colouring. Nothing intruded between his model and himself, no &ldquo;sombre
old master&rdquo; obscured his canvas. His execution is more personal, his colour
fresher and more transparent. The very personages seem with him to be
more elegant, more gracious, more modern than with Reynolds, in whose work,
through their kinship to the Renaissance, they received a suggestion of style,
classical and ancient.</p>

<p>In his pictures the Englishman is clearly revealed, an Englishman of that
delicacy and noble refinement which is present to a unique degree in the
works of English painters of the present day.</p>

<p>The passage from Hogarth to Gainsborough marks a chapter in the history
of English culture. Hogarth is the embodiment of John Bull; you can hear
him growl, like some savage bull-dog. That brutal, indecorous robustness
of England&rsquo;s aggressive youth becomes, in Gainsborough&rsquo;s hands, agreeable,
refined, gentle, and seductive. Reynolds, with his robustness as of the old
masters, might be best compared with Tintoretto; Gainsborough, in his quite
modern and fantastic elegance, is a more tender, subtle, and mysterious spirit,
poet and magician at once, like Watteau. There one listened to the full,
swelling chords of the organ; here to the soft, dulcet, silvery notes of the
violin. Reynolds loved warm,
brown and red tones; Gainsborough
essayed for the
first time, in a series of his
happiest creations, that scale
of colour, coldly green and
blue, in which to-day the
majority of English pictures
are still painted. Everything
with him is soft and clear; the
tone of those blue or light
yellow silks, which he loved
especially, is that of the most
transparent enamel; the background
fades away into
dreamy vapour, the figures are
surrounded with an atmosphere
of seduction. What a
masterpiece he has created in
the &ldquo;Blue Boy,&rdquo; his most
popular and most individual
picture. One can describe
every piece of the clothing,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>34</span>
but it is impossible to reproduce the harmony of the painting, the rich, pure
blue of the costume, which stands out against a lustrous, brown background
of landscape. How the stately youth stands, noble from head to foot, in
the brown and green autumn landscape, with its
canopy of sky! Master Bootall was by far the
most elegant portrait painted in England since
Van Dyck, and withal of a nervosity quite new.
See that youthful pride in the gaze, that mobile
sensibility in the pose!</p>

<p>Have men grown different, then, or does the
painter see further? One finds in Van Dyck no
such expressively <i>nervous</i> physiognomy. The
suggestion of melancholy, the deep reverie, the
noble, aristocratic haughtiness,&mdash;Gainsborough
was the first to discover that, and give it
its full expression. And the same man who
painted the noble elegance of this youthful
<i>grand seigneur</i> depicted also peasant children coming fresh from the
green fields and woodlands of their village homes. In Sir Joshua&rsquo;s
children there was often something borrowed from Correggio; the
children of Gainsborough breathe a rustic charm, an untamed savagery;
they are the very offshoots of nature, who disport themselves as freely
as the wild things in the woods. But his women in particular are creatures
altogether adorable. While Reynolds, the historical painter, liked to
promote his into heroines, those of Gainsborough, with their pure,
transparent skins, their sweet glances (in which there lies so admirable a
mixture of languishing fragility, innocence, and coquetry), are the true Englishwomen
of the eighteenth century. His &ldquo;Mrs. Siddons&rdquo; is not in theatrical
costume, but in a simple walking-dress; no Tragic Muse, but the passionate,
loving woman who once, a romantic, impulsive miss, escaped from a convent
at the risk of her life, to join a handsome young actor of her father&rsquo;s troupe
who had entirely fascinated her. What a charming grace in the pose, what
fine taste in the arrangement, what wonderful purity of colouring! With the
exception of Watteau, I know of no older master who could have painted such
moist, dreamy, sensuous, tender eyes. The marvellous &ldquo;Mrs. Graham,&rdquo; in
the National Gallery of Scotland, is, from the purely pictorial standpoint,
perhaps the greatest of all his works. Yet how beautiful is the double portrait
of that young married couple, the Halletts, who, tenderly holding hands, pass
along a deserted path in some secluded garden; or that pale, languishing &ldquo;Mrs.
Parsons,&rdquo; with her enchanting smile, and that mysterious language of the
eyes. Gainsborough was no keen observer, but he was a susceptible, sensitive
spirit who intercepted the soul itself, the play of the nerves, the slightest suggestion
of spiritual commotion. There moves through the majority of his portraits
a pathetic tenderness, a breath of dreamy melancholy, that the persons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>35</span>
themselves hardly possessed, but which he transfused into them out of himself.
Melancholy is the veil through which he saw things, as Reynolds saw them
through the medium of erudition. Reynolds was all will and intelligence,
Gainsborough all soul and temperament; and nothing can show the difference
between them better than the fact that Reynolds, who had formed his style
on early models, when he had no sitters painted historical pictures; whilst
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>36</span>
Gainsborough in like circumstances painted landscapes. Herein he was a
pioneer, whilst Reynolds was an issue of the past.</p>

<p>In the domain of landscape painting, too, the new germs of naturalism,
which had ventured above ground on all sides in the fifteenth century, had
been again stunted in the Great Renaissance. The theory had been promulgated
in the sixteenth century&mdash;in accordance with the idealistic
methods of the age&mdash;that it behoved the painter to improve upon nature just
as much as upon the human body. With the lofty style of the great figure
painters, and their artfully pondered composition, there corresponded a school
of landscape which was likewise conceived of, in the first degree, as an honourable,
architectural framing for a mythological episode. England too possessed,
in <i>Richard Wilson</i>, a believer in this doctrine, which became so widely promulgated
in the seventeenth century through the influence of Claude Lorraine.
The home of his soul was Italy. He scraped together a small sum of money
by portrait painting, borrowed the rest, and felt himself in his element for the
first time when he had reached Venice. Here, at the instance of Zucarrelli, he
became a painter of landscapes, and was aided in his endeavours by Joseph
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>37</span>
Vernet in Rome. He was on the way to become a painter in great request,
and in many of his pictures he shows a most delicate notion of well-balanced
and gracious composition in the manner of Claude. But his success was
of no long duration. Wilson, like so many other of his contemporaries, had
the fixed idea that the Creator had only made nature to serve as a framework
for the &ldquo;Grief of Niobe&rdquo; and as a vehicle for classical architecture. The
interpolated stage scenery of trees and the classic temples of this English
Claude, contain nothing which had not been already painted better by the
Frenchman. When the king, in order to assist him, asked him on one
occasion to represent Kew Gardens in a picture, he composed an entirely
imaginary landscape and illuminated it with the sun of Tivoli. The king
sent him back the picture, mordant epigrams appeared in the journals, and
Reynolds scoffed at him in his Discourses. After that Wilson spent his days
in the alehouse, until he got delirium, and died half starved at the age of
seventy.</p>

<p>The patriotic English were too much bound up with their own soil to acquire
a taste for the exotic, ideal scenery of Wilson. There existed in them that
patriotism, that feeling for home, which had turned the Dutch of the seventeenth
century into
landscape painters. In
this province also they
were destined to step
in, as the inheritors of
the Dutch, to bring
the germ of intimate
landscape to its
full fruition. Lovely
and luxuriant valleys
with their soft grass,
sweet woodlands with
their vari-coloured
foliage, golden, swaying
cornfields and picturesque
little cottages,
with that indescribable
softness of atmosphere,
must of themselves
direct the eye
of the writer and the
painter to all these
beauties. It was an
Englishman who in
the eighteenth century
wrote the most memorable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>38</span>
book upon the charms of nature. James Thomson, in his <i>Seasons</i>, is the
first great nature painter amongst the poets. Taine finds the whole of Rousseau
anticipated in him. &ldquo;Thirty years before Rousseau, Thomson had forestalled
all the sentiments of Rousseau, almost in the same style.&rdquo; He has not only,
like Rousseau, a profound feeling for the great wild aspects of nature, for the
forms of clouds, effects of light and contrasts of colour, but he delights also in
the smell of the dairy, in small birds, in the woodland shadows, and the light
on the meadows,&mdash;in all things sequestered and idyllic.</p>

<p>It was a remarkable chance which ordained that Thomas Gainsborough,
the first man who as a painter depicted the gracious charms of the country
of his birth, the comeliness of its expanses of deep green lush meadows,
the strength of the lofty, wide-spreading trees, as seen with the eyes
of a lover, should be born in the spring of the same year in which
Thomson&rsquo;s <i>Spring</i> appeared. That
he knew and admired Thomson
is proved by his dedication to him
of that delightful &ldquo;Musidora&rdquo; in
the National Gallery, a lovely woman
bathing her feet in some shady
forest pool. It is said that he only
sent half a dozen landscapes to the
Academy during the eighteen years
that he exhibited there. On the
other hand, they hung in his house
in Pall Mall in long rows on the
walls of his studio. After his death
his widow held a sale, at which
fifty-six landscapes were sold.
Gainsborough must be accounted
one of the moderns, so naïve and
intimate is the impression which his
pictures produce. He, who passed
his whole youth in the idyllic loveliness
of the woods, was fitted to be
the delineator of that mellow English
nature. He understood the
murmur of the brooks and the sighing
of the winds. Like his own
life, so regular and peaceful, gently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>39</span>
swaying as though to the friendly elements, are the trees in his pictures,
with their peaceful tranquillity; no storm disturbs the calm of a Gainsborough
picture. His was a contented, harmonious spirit, like Corot&rsquo;s.
His landscapes
know no tempestuous
grandeur;
they are
a playground
for children, a
place for shepherds
to rest.
&ldquo;The calm of
mid day, the
haze of twilight,
the dew
and the pearls
of morning,&rdquo;
said Constable,
&ldquo;are what we
find in the pictures
of this
good, kindly,
happy man....
As we look at
them the tears spring to our eyes, and we know not whence they come.
The solitary shepherd with his flock, the peasant returning from the
wood with his bundle of faggots, whispering woods and open dales, sweet
little peasant children with their pitchers in springtime,&mdash;that is what he
loved to paint and what he painted, with as much sought-out refinement
as with tender truth to nature.&rdquo; His landscapes are like windows opening
on the country, not compositions, but pieces taken straight out of that
fruitful English nature. Every year he used to return to his green pastures,
and paint very early, when the sun rose. Before him rose a cluster of trees, all
round the farm the flocks were grazing, thousands of busy bees flew buzzing from
flower to flower; goats, with their kids, were feeding in the meadows, wild
doves cooed, and the birds in the wood sang their praises to the Creator. Thus
do the landscapes of Gainsborough affect us. They are soft and tender as some
sweet melody in their discreet intimacy, without colorist effects, as wonderfully
harmonious as nature herself. A thatched cot, that peeps timidly from
between the great trees, a silvery dale shut in by weeping willows, a bridge
leading to some lush, green meadow,&mdash;those are Gainsborough&rsquo;s materials.
The famous &ldquo;Cottage Door&rdquo; is now at Grosvenor House. A young peasant
woman, with her youngest child in her arms, is standing by the door of a country
cottage, before which her other children are playing, some half naked; deep
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>40</span>
contentment is all around, huge old oaks spread their sheltering branches over
the roof on both sides; golden rays of sunshine dance across the meadow. Only
Frederick Walker has, in later days, painted such peasant women and such
children, at once so tender and so natural. Of the four pictures in the National
Gallery, &ldquo;The Wood Scene,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Watering Place,&rdquo; &ldquo;Market Carts,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Peasant Children,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Watering Place&rdquo; is the most celebrated. In
the foreground a quiet pasture with cows, close by the herdsman, a Suffolk
labourer; in the background a noble old Norman castle, perhaps Hedingham
Castle, near Sudbury. It is through pictures like these that England has
become the native-land of intimate landscape&mdash;<i>paysage intime</i>.</p>

<p>As figure painters, as well as landscape painters, the English in the
eighteenth century laid a course of their own, and it was not long before the
other nations followed them.</p>

<p class="center chap">CHAPTER II</p>

<p class="center chap2">THE HISTORICAL POSITION OF ART ON THE CONTINENT</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">Goethe</span> compared the history of knowledge with a great fugue: the
parts of the nations first come to light, little by little; and this analogy,
already once made by Hettner, holds true in a very high degree of the history
of art during the eighteenth century. The three great nations of culture&mdash;the
German, the English, and the French&mdash;take up their parts in turn,
and through all there sounds one common, equal, dominant note. England
was in the vanguard of that great period of struggle known as the age of
enlightenment. Since the middle of the eighteenth century English influences
had begun to fertilise the Continent. The truth and naturalness of English
ideas were introduced as models, and England became in her whole culture
the schoolmistress of the Continent. In every region war was declared against
the pedantry brought over from the past, while new conditions were aimed at.
Obviously it was not so easy for other nations to take their stand on the basis
of modern society. England had accomplished her revolution in the seventeenth
century; France was only preparing herself for hers. For all other
nations, too, the eighteenth century was a transition period, in which the old
and the new civilisation of culture were parting&mdash;an age of prodigious controversy,
full of <i>Sturm und Drang</i>. Men did homage to every kind of extravagance,
and went into ecstasies over virtue. The sarcasm of scoffers went hand in
hand with the deepest sentimental feeling for nature; superstition flourished by
the side of enlightenment and learning; in the <i>salons</i> of the aristocracy courtly
abbés file past with the greatest thinkers, glowing with a holy zeal for the
rights of man. And, in the midst of all this contradiction, there exists that
simple, virtuous middle class which is preparing to make the ascent which will
lead it to power.</p>

<p>One may imagine oneself in a salon of the <i>ancien régime</i>, in which wit
is lord, and laughter and merriment reign. Into that salon enters abruptly
a rough plebeian, with none of the fine tact of that company, yet a great,
aristocratic spirit, a man who despised such a society and would make the
world anew. Such is one&rsquo;s impression of the effect produced at the time by the
appearance of Jean Jacques Rousseau. Voltaire was the first on the Continent
to break through social barriers, but none the less he coined his heart for gold
in society. Rousseau signifies a great advance: he gave up his place, laid
aside rapier, silk stockings, and perruque, and clothed himself after the manner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>42</span>
of a common man in order to earn his bread as a copier of music. He is, as
Weigandt has called him, the first man of the <i>bourgeois</i> century, the first
pioneer of the new age. Against the traditions bequeathed by the past,
which in the course of time had
become over-refined and corrupt,
he set up the natural conditions
demanded by reason. His fight
against inequalities of rank is, as
it were, a foretaste of the revolution.
&ldquo;What hellish monsters are
these prejudices. I know no dishonourable
inferiority other than
that of character or education. A
man who is trained to an honourable
mind is the equal of the world;
there is no rank in which he would
not be in his place. It is better to
look down upon nobility than upon
virtue, and the wife of a charcoal-burner
is worthy of more respect
than the mistress of a prince.&rdquo;
Those were words in which the
coming revolution was presaged.</p>

<p>The <i>Nouvelle Heloise</i> appeared
in 1761. Thirteen years later followed Goethe&rsquo;s <i>Werther</i>, that history of a
young Titan whose zeal for liberty felt all the partition walls of Society to
be prison walls, and who rose against everything that was ceremonial,
against all the subordinations of the social hierarchy, against all trivial
and rigid rules of prudent everyday life. Werther abhorred rules in every
sphere. &ldquo;One can say much in favour of rules, about as much as one
can say in praise of <i>bourgeois</i> society.&rdquo; He scoffed at the Philistines,
who daily went along the same measured way. He saw in &ldquo;Society,&rdquo;
having hitherto moved in the simple world of the <i>bourgeois</i>, &ldquo;the
most sacred and the most pitiful emotions wholly without clothing.&rdquo; And
this Society outraged him, and sent him with contumely from its midst.
&ldquo;Working folk carried him to the grave, and no minister of religion followed
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Soon afterwards young Schiller came upon the scene with his first
works, which were a declaration of war against all the foundations of human
society, those manifestoes of revolution which, were they new writings to-day,
no Court Theatre would dare to produce. The fierce, rampant lion, with the
inscription &ldquo;In Tyrannos,&rdquo; which was displayed on the title-page of the
second edition of the <i>Robbers</i>, was an intimate symbol of the deep revolutionary
spirit that inspired the whole age. &ldquo;I grew disgusted with this ink-stained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>43</span>
age, when I read in my <i>Plutarch</i> of great men. Fie, fie upon the flaccid,
castrated century, that has no other use than to chew over again the deeds of
the past. Let me imagine an army of fellows like you, and I see a republic
arising in Germany, in comparison with which those of Rome and Sparta
would be convents of nuns.&rdquo; In a loud voice <i>Ficsco</i> proclaims itself on the
very title-page to be a &ldquo;republican&rdquo; tragedy. <i>Intrigue and Love</i> even aims
full at the rottenness and corruption of the actual time. It can be traced&mdash;and
Brandes has done it in his <i>Haupströmungen</i>&mdash;how in the literature of the age,
the life of sensibility and idealism prevailing in the previous century gradually
dwindles, and in its stead quite modern progressive views&mdash;religious, political,
and social&mdash;surge up in an ever-increasing wave. The authors were the
bold inciters to the battle. They were all leaders in the battle for liberty
against fossilised tradition,&mdash;some in the field of poetry only, others in the
whole sphere of intellectual life. These are they who gave the signal for the
war-cry of the Revolution&mdash;Liberty, Equality, Fraternity; who rent asunder
the old society, inaugurated the age of citizenship, and were at the same time
the first to lose, as quite modern spirits, their faith in another world.</p>

<p>A wonderful chance ordained that, in the province of art, the most
powerful figure of that storm
and tumult, the one artist of the
age of the race of Prometheus,
to which belonged the young
Goethe and the young Schiller,
should be born in the most mediæval
country in Europe, on
Spanish soil. Against an art
that was more catholic than
catholicism, courtly and mystical,
there came by far the greatest
reaction in Goya. From Roelas,
Collantes, and Murillo to him
there is hardly any transition.</p>

<p><i>Francisco Goya</i> preached
Nihilism in the home of belief.
He denied everything, believed
nothing, doubted of everything,
even of that peace and liberty
which he hoped to be at hand.
That old Spanish art of religion
and dogma was changed under
his hands to an art of negation
and sarcasm. His attitude is
not that of an insolent and impetuous
youth, who puts out his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>44</span>
tongue at the Academy and strikes with audacious hand at the academicians&rsquo;
high powdered perruques; it is the attitude of the modern spirit, which
begins by doubting all things which have been honoured hitherto. His
Church pictures are devoid of religious feeling, and his etchings replete with
sneers at everything which was previously esteemed as authority. He scoffs
at the clerical classes and the religious orders, laughs at the priestly raiment
which covered the passions of humanity. Spanish art, which began in a blind
piety, becomes in Goya revolutionary, free, modern.</p>

<p>Goya is, in his whole nature, a modern man, a restless, feverish soul;
nervous as a <i>décadent</i>; temperament to his finger-tips. His style in portraiture,
his art of composition, his whole method,&mdash;all speak to our artists to-day in a
language easily understood, and on many of them the influence of Goya is
unmistakable. He is one of the most fascinating figures of the beginning of
the century. As audacious as he was clever, as versatile as he was fantastic,
a keen observer as well as a strong creative spirit, he fascinates and astonishes
in his pictures, just as in his wonderful etchings, by a remarkable mixture
of the bizarre and the original. His pictures, whether they be violent or
eccentric, tender or hard, gloomy or joyous, nearly always move and
palpitate with life itself, and they will always keep their attraction. There
is no one of Goya&rsquo;s pictures, not even the flimsiest sketch, at which one can
look coldly.</p>

<p>He was born in a village in the province of Aragon, the son of a small
landed proprietor, in 1746. At the age of fourteen, having already painted
frescoes in the church of his native-place, he went to Saragossa as an
apprentice; and there he showed himself to be vivacious and passionate,
and soon became the champion among his comrades in all their pastimes
and brawls. Restless, and always thinking of adventure, he refused every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>45</span>
regular kind of education, disarranged everything in his master&rsquo;s studio,
worked when he could, drew his sword when he had a mind to, nourished
in his head dark thoughts on liberty, came and went and loved, dallied
with his knife, snapped his fingers at the Inquisition, which was after him,
and fled from Madrid,&mdash;such was he at twenty, and such he remained all
his life.</p>

<p>Italy, whither he fled on account of a duel, did not alter him. There were
new love quarrels. He fought, stabbed a rival, was wounded himself, amused
himself extremely, studied little, observed, admired, but neither painted nor
copied anything. It was thanks to this indolence that the great past did not
take him prisoner. He did not know much, but for what he knew he could
thank himself. He loved the old painters, but platonically; their works did
not lead him astray. In this lies the explanation of his qualities and his
faults: that marvellous mixture of seductive grace and visible weakness, of
subtlety and brutality, of refinement and ignorance. He merits equally
sympathy and blame, is as genial as he is unequal. But one would not wish
him to be otherwise: if there had been more order and proportion in his
works his good qualities would have been lost. He would have suffered in
spontaneity, vivacity, originality, and quietly taken his anchorage in the
sleepy haven of mediocrity. As he is, he is wholly the child of his country:
from head to foot a Spaniard of the eighteenth century, a son of that downfallen
Spain that was dying from loss of blood. For hundreds of years a
black cloud, extinguishing all joy, had hung over Spanish life, a cloud out of
which, only here and there in dismal lightning flashes, there emerged obscure
figures of sombre despots, sick ascetics, and silent martyrs. All mundane
inclinations were suppressed, all sensuous desires prohibited. Men spent
their nights with their eyes fixed upon the gory histories and passionate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>46</span>
exhortations of the Old Testament, hearing in imagination the menacing,
thunderous voice of a dreadful God, until at last in their own hearts the
fanatical inspiration of the prophetic seer awoke anew, and their feverish
forms were torn asunder by
ecstatic visions and religious
hallucinations. When Goya
began his career the sinister
country of the Inquisition had
grown frivolous. A breath of
revolution was passing over
men&rsquo;s minds. An intoxicating
odour of mundane voluptuousness
penetrated everywhere,
even into the convents themselves;
the figures of the French
Rococo Olympus had brought
confusion into the Christian
paradise. Spain no longer
believed; it laughed at the
Inquisition, trembled no more
when it was threatened with
the pains of Hell. It had
grown frivolous, wanton, epicurean,
full of grace and
laughter. The rosy-red and
blue shepherds of the Trianon
had made an entry into the
sombre Court of Aranjuez.
Literature, taste, and art were
infected by French influences, Parisian sparks of wit, lightning <i>esprit</i>, and
Parisian immorality; and the same rumbling earthquake which wrecked the
throne of France was soon to shatter that of Spain. In Goya&rsquo;s works there
is a refulgence of all this. But, like every great artist, he is not only the
expression of his epoch, but also its leader; he almost anticipates the age
which shall succeed it. Like a figure of Janus, on the border-line between
two centuries, standing in a manner between two worlds, he was the last
of the old masters and the first of the moderns&mdash;even in that special sense
in which we employ the word to-day.</p>

<p>Through a commission to design cartoons for the Spanish manufactories of
tapestry, he was brought into contact with the Court. Member of the Academy
of San Fernando in 1780, Pintor del Rey, with an income of 12,500 francs in
1786, he became soon afterwards the Director of the Madrid Academy&mdash;the
drollest Director of an Academy that man can imagine! Goya, the peasant
youth, with his bull neck and matador-like strength, lived at the Spanish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>47</span>
Court in the midst of the enervated scions of a dissolute aristocracy, who, with
their sickly and anæmic features, indolent and impotent, skulked through life,
young men prematurely old.  Naturally he was the idol of the women,
hated by the courtiers on account of his caustic wit, a terror to all husbands
because of his perpetual intrigues, and at the same time feared as the best
swordsman in Madrid, who drew his rapier with the indifference with which
we light a cigarette.</p>

<p>It is only as the outcome of such a personality that his works are to be
understood.</p>

<p>Goya was far too great a sceptic to put a religious sentiment into matters
in which he no longer believed; his talent was far too modern for the
religious abstraction to be able to seize him. His &ldquo;Christ on the Cross,&rdquo;
therefore, in the Museo del Prado, is simply tedious, a bad academical
study. His frescoes in San Antonio de la Florida, at Madrid, exhibit a
pretty, decorative motive&mdash;considerable movement, grace, and spirit. But
amongst them are angels who sit there most irreverently, and, with a
laugh of challenge, throw out their legs <i>à la</i> Tiepolo. The chief picture
represents St. Antony of Padua raising a man from the dead. But all
that interested him in it were
the lookers-on. On a balustrade
all around he has
brought in the lovely, dainty
faces of numerous ladies of the
court, his <i>bonnes amies</i>, who
lean their elbows on the balcony
and coquette with the people
down below. Their plump,
round, white hands play meaningly
with their fans; a thick
cluster of ringlets waves over
their bared shoulders; their
sensual eyes languish with a
seductive fire; a faint smile
plays round their voluptuous
lips. Several seem only just
to have left their beds, and
their vari-coloured, gleaming
silks are crumpled. One is
just arranging her coiffure,
which has come undone and
falls over her rosy bosom;
another, with a languishing
unconsciousness and a careless
attitude, is opening her sleeve,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>48</span>
whose soft, deep folds expose a snow-white arm. There is much <i>chic</i> in this
Church picture. One very immodest angel is supposed to be the portrait
of the Duchess of Alba, who was famed for her numerous intrigues.</p>

<p>In his portraits, too, he is
unequal. He became the fashionable
painter at the court.
The politicians, poets, scholars,
great ladies, actresses, all the
famous folk of his epoch, sat
to him. He daubed more than
two hundred portraits; but
they were good only when the
subject amused him. His
portraits of the Royal Family
have something vicious and
plebeian. He is too little in
earnest, too little of an official,
to paint court pictures. One
might imagine that he with
difficulty restrained himself
from laughing at the pompous
futility which stood before
him. It irritated him to be
obliged to paint these great
lords and ladies in poses so
ceremonial, instead of making
them, like the angels of San
Antonio, throw up their legs
and skip over parapets. The
Queen, Marie Louise, is frankly grotesque; and the family of Charles <span class="sc">IV</span> look
like the family of a shopkeeper who have won the big prize in a lottery, and
been photographed in their Sunday clothes. But, ah! when something gives
him pleasure! In the Exhibition of Portraits at Paris, in 1885, there was
the portrait of a young man, dressed in gray, which excelled Gainsborough
for grace. With what a noble nonchalance this young elegant stands
there, reminding one, in attitude and costume, of the <i>incroyables</i> of Charles
Vernet. With what equanimity does he look out on life, in his satisfaction
at the good fit of his clothes. The wonderful harmony of the grey tones
was rendered with all Gainsborough&rsquo;s delicacy. The same man who in
those pictures of ceremony let himself go in a manner so brusque and
frenzied, here revelled, a very Proteus in his chameleon-like qualities,
in soft and mellow and seductive tones. One might say that he has
thought here of Prudhon and Greuze, and joined their study to the cult of
Velasquez.</p>

<p>Still more charming was he in his pictures of young girls, when he was
himself fascinated by the attractions of his subjects. The infantile Donna
Maria Josefa (at the Prado) and the twelve-year-old Queen Isabella of Sicily
(at Seville) are admirable pictures. In them the candour and grace of budding
youth, the whole poetry of young maidenhood, have won life and expression
from the enamoured tenderness of an artist hand. Seduced by beauty, he
renounced all irony, thought only of those big, wide-opened eyes of velvet,
those rosy young lips; of that warm carnation and the elegant slimness of
that soft young neck that rose in delicate contour from the shoulders. Or
again, that marvellous double portrait of La Maja in the Academy of San
Fernando: a young girl painted once clothed and once nude, both pictures
in exactly the same pose, and both flooded with the same extraordinary
sensuous charm. This is not the uncertain, sarcastic painter of those State
pictures. It is an attentive observer, who depicts with sensitive devotion the
harmonious lines of the irradiating, young, human body so worthy of celebration.
The transparent stuff that covers the body of &ldquo;La Maja clothed&rdquo;
reveals all that it hides; in the other picture the unveiled nudity sings the
high pæan of the flesh. The drawing is sure, the modelling of a marvellous
tenderness. The heaving
bosom, the slender limbs,
the tantalising eyes&mdash;every
part of that nervous body,
with its ivory whiteness,
stretched out on the milk-white
couch made for love,
breathes of pleasure and
voluptuousness.</p>

<p>In pictures of this kind
Goya is wholly one of us.
Grown independent of every
traditional rule, he abandoned
himself entirely to his own
impressions, and produced
enduring works, vibrating
with life, because he was himself
fascinated with nature.
He showed here an idea of
modernity that almost makes
him seem a contemporary of
our own&mdash;that zeal for the
pictorial, for colour and light,
which attracts us so much
to-day. Very characteristic
also of the changed aspect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>50</span>
of the age are his designs for the famous tapestry in Santa Barbara, with
which he made his début at Madrid. They are very crude in decoration.
Two or three neat young girls, with big, black, moist eyes, here and
there pleasing details&mdash;a couple
of men carrying a wounded
companion&mdash;are unable to gloss
over the heaviness of the composition
and colour. But it was
of great consequence that Goya
should have had courage for so
bold a step as to make use of
character scenes in decorative
painting at a time when everywhere
else, without exception,
<i>fêtes champêtres</i> predominated.</p>

<p>In his oil paintings he went
much further in this direction.
In that impetuous manner peculiar
to him he endeavoured to
get a firm grip on the pictorial
side of Spanish life, at home
and in the streets, wherever he
found it. The most fearful subjects&mdash;such
as the two great
slaughter scenes in the French
invasion, painted with such
breadth and fierceness&mdash;alternate
with incidents of the liveliest
character. Everything is
jotted down, under the immediate
influence of what has been observed, by rapid methods, and on this
account produces an effect of sketches taken with complete directness from
nature. In those careless pictures, swept with large strokes of the brush,
there rises before us the mad drama of public holiday in the streets and in
the circus: processions, bull-fights, brigands, the victims of the plague,
assassinations, scenes of gallantry, national types&mdash;all observed with the
acuteness of a Menzel. The Majas on the balcony in the Montpensier Gallery,
the &ldquo;Breakfast on the Grass,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Flower Girl,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Reaper,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Return
from Market,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Cart attacked by Brigands,&rdquo; are the most piquant,
vividly coloured of these pictures. The &ldquo;Romeria de San Isidoro&rdquo; is full
of such a sparkling, stirring life as the most modern of the impressionists
alone have learned again to paint. A few dashes of colour, a few well-placed,
bold strokes of the brush, and at once one sees the procession move,
the groups passing each other by just as, in the marvellous sketches of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>51</span>
funeral of Sardina, in the Academy of San Fernando, one can see the young
couples revolve madly in the dance, and the lances of the bull-fighters redden
the sand of the arena.</p>

<p>The superabundance of such phantasy could not, of course, be achieved
by the tardy brush. He required a quicker medium, that would permit him
to express everything. Therefore he executed his numerous etchings, by which
he was rendered famous, before people had learnt to appreciate him as a
painter: the &ldquo;Capriccios,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Malheurs de la Guerre,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Bull-fights,&rdquo;
the &ldquo;Captives&rdquo;&mdash;those marvellous and fantastic pages in which he expressed
everything that his feverish, satirical soul had accumulated for contempt,
and hatred, and anger, and scorn. The etcher&rsquo;s needle was the poisoned
dagger with which he attacked all that he wished to attack: tyranny, superstition,
intrigue, adultery, honour that is sold and beauty that lets itself
be bought, the arrogance of the great and the degrading servility of the little.
He made an awful and jovial hecatomb of all the vices and the scandals of
the age. Whomsoever he pilloried was laid bare in all respects; physically
and morally, no single trait of him was forgotten. And he did it so
wittily that he compelled even
the offended person to laugh.
Neither Charles <span class="sc">IV</span> himself,
nor the Court, nor the Inquisition,
which bled most beneath
his thrusts, dared to complain.</p>

<p>In his &ldquo;Capriccios&rdquo; Goya
stands revealed as a figure
without even a forerunner in
the history of art. Satirical
representations of popular
superstitions, bitter, mordant
attacks on the aristocracy, the
government, and all social
conditions, unprecedented assaults
on the crown, on religion
and its doctrines, inexorable
satires upon the Inquisition
and the monastic orders, make
up this most remarkable book.
It had hardly appeared in
1796 before the Inquisition
seized it. Goya parried this
stroke, however, by dedicating
the plates to the king.</p>

<p>A painter and a colorist,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>52</span>
in this book he displays his genius as an etcher. The outlines are drawn
with light and genial strokes only; then comes the <i>aquatinta</i>, the colouring
which overspreads the background, and gives localisation, depth, and
light. A few scratches of the
needle, a black spot, a light
produced by a spot of white
ingeniously left blank&mdash;that sufficed
to give life and character
to his figures.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Misères de la Guerre&rdquo;
are intrinsically more serious.
All the scenes of terror that occurred
in Spain as a sequel to
the French invasion and the
glory of Napoleon here utter
their cry of lamentation. A
few plates amongst them are
worthy of comparison with
the finest of Rembrandt&rsquo;s,&mdash;the
sole classic for whom Goya
cherished a veneration. All the
undertakings which followed
these&mdash;the &ldquo;Bull-fights,&rdquo; the
&ldquo;Proverbs,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Captives,&rdquo;
the fantastic landscapes&mdash;tell of
a long study of the great Dutch
master. Especially celebrated
were the seventeen new plates
which he added to the &ldquo;Malheurs
de la Guerre&rdquo; in 1814,
at the time of the restoration of Ferdinand <span class="sc">VII</span>. They are the political
and philosophical testament of the old liberal, the keen free-thinker, the
last and utmost fight for all that he loved against all that he hated.
With sacred wrath and biting irony he waged war against the intrigues
and hypocrisy of the obscurantists who throttle progress and suppress
freedom of thought. With passionate wrath he rushed upon kings,
priests, and dignitaries. It seems incredible that the plate entitled
&ldquo;Nada&rdquo;&mdash;a dead man, who comes out of his grave and writes with
his corpse-fingers the word &ldquo;Nada&rdquo; (nothing)&mdash;that this plate can be
the work of a Spaniard of the eighteenth century. Everywhere there
is the same hatred of tyranny, of social injustice, of human stupidity,
the same incredulous effort after a dimly conceived ideal of truth and
liberty.</p>

<p>It is neither the amiable fairyland of Callot nor the <i>bourgeois</i> pessimism
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>53</span>
of Hogarth. Goya is more inexorable and acute; his phantasy, borne
on larger wings, takes a higher flight. He sees direful figures in his
dreams, his laugh is bitter, his anger rancorous. He is a revolutionist,
an agitator, a sceptic, a nihilist. His <i>chronique scandaleuse</i> grows into the
epos of the age. One understands why such a man should no longer feel
secure in Spain, and, towards the close of his life, go into exile in
France.</p>

<p>There, too, in the home of the revolution, art, ever since the beginning of
the century, had freed herself more from the tradition of the Renaissance,
and betaken herself to the new way, which the Dutch, and soon afterwards
the English, had laid down in the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>All that had been produced in Paris, up to the close of the seventeenth
century, had had its birthplace in the Italy of Leo <span class="sc">X</span>. The light of
the Italian Renaissance had suffused France ever since the appearance of
Rosso and Primaticcio. Rome had been the cradle of Simon Vouet and
Nicolas Poussin. France endeavoured, in rich decoration and masterly
swing of lines, to overtop the Italians, whose formulæ were studied partly in
Rome and partly in the Palace
of Fontainebleau, that Rome <i>in
petto</i>. Those religious pictures
of Lebrun, arranged in panels,
appeared with their theatrically
elegant attitudes and their flowing
drapery, with their slim,
oscillating limbs and their florid
gestures. All Olympus, all the
saints and the heroes, were set to
work to do honour to the great
king. Was it necessary to glorify
his acts, then it was done by
portraying him as Cyrus or
Alexander. The people of the
seventeenth century did not exist
for painters. Lebrun and Mignard,
as inheritors of Roman culture,
hovered over life without seeing
it. Their ideals were a hundred
and fifty years old, ingenious
variations on the sixteenth-century
pattern.</p>

<p>Then came the death of the
<i>Grand Monarque</i>, and with him
the tradition of the Renaissance
went also to its grave. The old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>54</span>
age was outworn, and the new began to supersede it. The world was
weary of the majestic, the stiff, and the pompous, whose glamour had
blinded it for sixty years. The sun-king was dead, and the sun of the
Italian Renaissance had set. French society breathed once more. The
ostentation of the court had become an onerous ceremony, the monarchical
principle an unendurable constraint. The nightmare that had oppressed
it, the ennui that had come from Versailles, disappeared. Air and light
and mirth penetrated the salons. People shook off the heavy yoke of
majesty from their shoulders, abandoned their heroic, ostentatious palaces,
and bought themselves <i>petites maisons</i> in the <i>Bois</i>. They had suffered,
they wished to be glad; they had been bored, they wished to be amused.
Enough of pater-nosters and stately etiquette! they wished to live. Away
with the antique temples and goddesses of Poussin! away with those
devoted martyrs who mortified themselves and killed the flesh! Away
with the semblance of the heroic, with pomp and glamour, with the service
of God and the service of lords! Here&rsquo;s to the service of the ladies.
Here&rsquo;s to the thatched roofs of farmhouses; the woods in whose thickets
one can lose one&rsquo;s way and exchange a kiss; rosy flesh and little turned-up
noses; everything which gave a thrill of voluptuousness after the unapproachable,
icy-cold nobility of the past. Long live Love!</p>

<p>So thought France when Louis <span class="sc">XIV</span> was dead, and the man was
already grown up in the Low Countries who was chosen to give a shape
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>55</span>
to these dreams, to abolish the ascendency of gods and kings and heroes, and
to show the upper classes their own image reflected in the mirror of art.</p>

<p><i>Antoine Watteau</i>, who guided the stream of French art into this new
channel&mdash;of the Netherlands&mdash;was by birth and training a Fleming. His
birthplace, Valenciennes, although French territory since the Peace of
Nymeguen, resembled in its whole character a Flemish town. In the church
here he first saw any of Rubens&rsquo; pictures. Here, through Gérin, he
became instructed in Flemish traditions. Rubens and Teniers are the two
masters from whom his own art sprang. During the years when the war
of the Spanish Succession had changed the French frontier provinces into a
huge military camp, he painted soldiers and camp scenes, such as the &ldquo;March&rdquo;
in the collection of Edmund Rothschild, where a party of recruits are straggling
along a high plain in a fierce storm. Later came pictures of country
life in the manner of Teniers, like the &ldquo;Retour de Guinguette,&rdquo; engraved
by Chedel, a landscape in which on the right a party of rustics are carousing
at a table in front of a farmyard, while on the other side half-drunken men and
women are going home. Louis <span class="sc">XIV</span> had made before the pictures of Teniers
his well-known <i>mot</i>: &ldquo;<i>Otez moi ces magots</i>.&rdquo; Now, through Watteau, the
<i>magot</i> makes its entrance into French art. Thus in his chief picture in
this manner, &ldquo;La Vraie Gaieté,&rdquo; the figures are unmistakably after Teniers.
The men are short and sturdy, entirely Flemish. Only the costumes have
changed with the mode. But the women are not in the least Flemish. The
clean caps and tidy kerchiefs, the freshly ironed aprons, and neat little feet
that trip so lightly and quickly along the street that no dirt seems to soil
them, give these peasant girls a certain desirability in which it is not hard
to discover the transition to French grace. The elegant motions and
fine heads point to that Watteau who was to become soon afterwards the
unsurpassable delineator of feminine coquetry.</p>

<p>Gillot and Rubens led him into the new road. The Teniers-like character
of his figures disappeared, they became gracious and noble. In place of the
<i>magot</i> came elegant French society. Gillot was the first in Paris to break
with the pompous Louis <span class="sc">XIV</span> style, and to begin the representation of the
cheerful life of comedians, to replace the dwellers in Olympus by characters
of the French and Italian stage. Rubens had been the first in his &ldquo;Garden
of Love,&rdquo; of the Dresden and Madrid Galleries, to invite to the embarkation
for the Island of Cythera. Watteau acquired something from everyone he
studied, and yet resembles none. After having hitherto sought his personages
on the highways and in camps, he was now to become the painter
of <i>fêtes galantes</i>, the painter of &ldquo;Society.&rdquo; For in his shepherds and shepherdesses
there lives the elegance of France. The gods of the Renaissance,
in whom no one any longer believed, glided into the costumes of Harlequin
and Pierrette. In lieu of the great and the pathetic there came the small,
the gay, the graceful, the dainty. The architectural symmetry of composition
disappeared, and the stiff stage-scenery character of landscape vanished.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>56</span>
The grave formality of geometrical construction is changed into freedom and
joyousness, just as the rhetorical, exact, measured periods of Boileau were
relaxed, under the hands of Voltaire, into sentences unconstrained, buoyant,
and crisp. Watteau&rsquo;s art betokened the triumph of naturalism over the
mannerism into which the French art of the seventeenth century, based on
the Italian Renaissance, had dwindled. As it is said in an old poem&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg f90" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>&ldquo;Parée à la Françoise, un jour Dame Nature</p>
<p class="i05">Eut le desir coquet de voir sa portraiture.</p>
<p class="i05">Que fit la bonne mère? Elle enfanta Watteau.&rdquo;</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p>Watteau became for French art what, a hundred years before, Rubens
had been for Flemish&mdash;the deliverer. He delivered them from the oppressive
yoke of the Italian tradition. In his world, where there were no longer any
naked goddesses, but where the corset was opened only just wide enough to
reveal a rosy bosom, there was nothing more left of the past. It is no longer
antique beauty, no longer the plastic cold of the &ldquo;Venus di Milo,&rdquo; no longer
the marble perfection of Raphael&rsquo;s &ldquo;Galatea.&rdquo; Into those tender, feminine
hands, into those lace sleeves, out of which snow-white arms come languishingly
forth, into those slender waists, and teasing, dimpled chins, something
of coquetry, of sensibility, something subtle and spiritual, has entered, that
seems to transcend physical beauty. His young men are tall and supple, his
women entirely indescribable, with their air of quiet roguishness and their
exquisite coiffures. Quite modern is that distinguished sense for costume
which made him a leader of fashion.  Mysterious landscapes, that exhale
peace and happiness all around! Rightly has Edmond de Goncourt called
him a lyric poet, the great poet of
the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>In this way the development
proceeded. The pompous representation
which portrait painting
had practised hitherto was gone.
People would no longer be masters
of the ceremonies, but human
beings. New forms of technique
were discovered, such as pastel
painting. No other material was
capable of rendering the peculiar
fragrance of this fugitive flower
nature, the graceful appearance of
this <i>rococo</i> style, of these ladies
with the touch of powder in their
hair, and their moist, dreamy eyes,
as Maurice Latour, Rosalba Carriera,
and later the Swiss, Liotard, painted
them. Of those who endeavoured,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>57</span>
on the model of Watteau&rsquo;s style, to depict the life of the fashionable
world, none approached the delicacy of that national genius. <i>Lancret</i>
and <i>Pater</i> followed him, but more roughly, more soberly, more drily.
Lancret in his whole conception, compared with Watteau, is a homely,
often a somewhat cumbrous journeyman; Pater, an artist of greater
elegance, has the fickleness of the virtuoso. Both in conviction and in
art they lacked that poetic, glorifying breath which pervades Watteau&rsquo;s
creations. In Watteau one <i>believes</i> that these gracious beings, these tall
and nervous cavaliers, these amiable coquettes and comely women, actually
represent originals in noble society; whereas in the works of his disciples
it often happens that the paid model, selected from a lower circle of
society, appears to us to be not congruous with the elegance of her
wardrobe. These dancers, huntsmen, and noble maidens are not wholly
what they should represent. But how delicious they are, these French
gossips, so long as one is mindful <i>not</i> to think of Watteau! What
grace is theirs too! What innate tact! With what a pleasant adroitness
do they understand how to rivet our attention, and to keep far, far
away from the tedium in which their classical ancestors, with their natural
heaviness, waded! Instinctively and without effort they rejected the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>58</span>
rhythmically balanced composition and correct nobility of form of the
classics, and found a characteristic expression for unconstrained gestures,
pleasing movements, and refined elegance.</p>

<p>Even the decorative painters abandoned more
and more the much-worn paths of the Italians.
<i>François Lemoine</i> gave them, by Rubens&rsquo; aid, the
transition to a manner peculiarly French, elegant,
sensuous, charming. His pupil, <i>François Boucher</i>,
followed him. Like the sons of the seventeenth century,
he made exhaustive use of mythological subjects
and was often a superficial artist, and in his later
works he became entirely a mannerist; but he was
not so at the beginning. It was a great advance
for France when Boucher gave his pupils the
advice to abstain from imitation of the great Italian masters, and not to
grow &ldquo;as cold as ice.&rdquo; And what a great naturalist he is in his numerous
drawings and etchings, and in those marvellous groups of chubby children
who are playing and tumbling about on clouds, or playing musical
instruments shooting arrows, or sporting with flowers!  &ldquo;It is not every
one who has the stuff to make a Boucher&rdquo; even his great antagonist David
has said of him.</p>

<p>In <i>Fragonard</i>, again, there was summed up all the joy of life and the
frivolity, the lustrous, luxurious talent, the charming amiability and nimble
sureness, of French art in the eighteenth century. Fragonard has painted
everything. His great decorations are careless inspirations, sparkling with spirit
and life. With him pastoral scenes alternate with episodes of everyday life&mdash;children,
guitar players, women reading. Fragonard is a piquant, ingenious
painter. Perhaps hardly any other painter has so much kissing in his
pictures. His etching, &ldquo;L&rsquo;armoire,&rdquo; of 1778, is well known. In that he
already stood on the sure ground of popular life. The old rustic, who is
armed with a formidable cudgel, is beating open, with the assistance of his
wife, the doors of a great clothes cupboard, in which a handsome young
fellow has hidden himself; close by is a pretty farm girl, weeping in confusion
into her apron; in the background the curious and amazed little
sisters are looking on.</p>

<td class="tcr f90 pb2">THE MILKMAID.</td></tr></table>

<p><i>J. F. de Troy</i> had, at the same time, abandoned himself to a more frolicsome
manner, had played upon painting in pictures such as &ldquo;The Proposal
of Marriage&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Garter&rdquo; with something of that frivolity which later
came into fashion through Baudouin. That, however, was only for a very
short time. Life was beginning to be in earnest&mdash;that is rather the impression
one receives much earlier, from turning over the engravings of
those years. Amongst the elders of the actual <i>rococo</i> age, contentment
and gaiety still rule. As the heirs of an old civilisation, the aristocracy
understood, with a refined and unique understanding, how to turn life
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>59</span>
into a feast. Silk trains rustle over the parquet, silk shoes trip, eyes
gleam, diamonds flash, white bosoms heave. Tall cavaliers advance to
their sprightly partners, gossip and smiles fly around, Knights of Malta and
abbés hang over the chairs and pay their court. Yes, this autumn of the old
French culture was of a marvellous beauty for the fortunate, and those fortunate
ones knew, as no other generation has ever done, how to enjoy life with
serenity, in a fairy glamour of rooms gleaming with Venetian chandeliers, where
rosy Cupidons laughed down bewitchingly from their light, gold moulded
panels. Under Louis XVI the French salon acquired another aspect. Its walls,
its whole architecture, were more sombre. The Cupidons still sported on the
ceiling, but they were forgotten, like ghosts of the past; their shafts were
already impotent. The vivacious, dancing couples have disappeared. Festivity
has been banished from the big rooms: here and there is seen an earnest conversational
party; gentlemen playing cards or ladies reading philosophical
books. Social and political interests have sprung up with which people of
education prefer to occupy themselves. Numerous works on commerce and
constitutional methods have appeared during the last fifty years. In place
of scandal there crop up arguments, for and against the Parliament, for and
against the Jesuits. Enlightenment had won its victory. Henceforth
development is no longer compatible with sensuous delight. It is still the
same society as before, but without pleasure. One almost breathes the air
of 1789. Gaming is only a struggle against ennui; the foreheads of women
are furrowed with reading. Society has grown serious and sombre, as it were,
with a presentiment of what is to come, as though destiny might thus be set
aside. The writings of Diderot afford the clearest instance of this changed
spirit of the age, and art too must
become virtuous, and work for the
amelioration of the world. Thus
Diderot upheld the sentimental and
emotional subject against the <i>fêtes
galantes</i> of the <i>rococo</i> painter. Boucher
derived his inspiration from the slough
of prostitution; only a moral upheaval
could tend to a high style. With
Boucher the idea of honour, of innocence,
has become something strange;
the new age requires virtue, <i>bonnes
m&oelig;urs</i>. But where are the virtues to
be found? Naturally, there alone,
where Rousseau had discovered them.
Rousseau taught that man by nature
was good, that he was noble, conscious
of his moral obligations, self-sacrificing
and uncorrupted when he came from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>60</span>
the hands of his Maker, and that it was civilisation which first corrupted
him. It followed that the most civilised are the most corrupt, and virtues
are to be met with, if anywhere, amongst the lower orders, who are the
least affected by culture. Not beneath
an embroidered waistcoat, only
beneath a woollen smock, can a
noble heart beat. The happy ignorance
of the young Savoyard, eating
his cheese or his oranges in
a church porch, lies nearer to the
original perfection of mankind than
the most subtle erudition of the
most ingenious of the encyclopædists.
Amongst nature&rsquo;s noblemen
one must seek for the secret of
virtue, which has been lost by the
aristocracy in the stream of civilisation.
Thus beneath the ægis of Rousseau&rsquo;s
philosophy the Third Estate
makes its entry into French salons.
From the man of the people society
wanted to learn how to become once
more simple, unassuming, and
virtuous; and it was a gruesome irony of fate that this &ldquo;man of the
people&rdquo; should reveal himself later, when the guillotine stood in the Place
de la Concorde, as by no means so lamblike, modest, and self-sacrificing as
that noble society had imagined him.</p>

<p><i>Greuze</i> represented this phase of French art when the riotous carnival of
<i>rococo</i> had come to an end, and the Ash Wednesday of rule and fasting and
penitence had ensued. It was considered that the aim of art must be to instruct
and elevate, not merely to amuse; it should set an example to raise and inspire
the good, to serve as a warning for the bad. &ldquo;<i>Rendre la vertu aimable, le vice
odieux, le ridicule saillant, voilà le projet de tout honnête homme qui prend la plume,
le pinceau ou le ciseau.</i>&rdquo; In these words Diderot formulated his programme. It
was his wish that the corrupt man, when he went to an exhibition, should feel
pricks of conscience at the pictures and read in them his own condemnation.
&ldquo;<i>Si ses pas le conduisent au Salon, qu&rsquo;il craigne d&rsquo;arrêter ses regards sur la
toile.</i>&rdquo; Educational effects, &ldquo;moral stories told in pictures,&rdquo; that is the keynote
of Diderot&rsquo;s demands upon the painter, and of the accomplishment of
Greuze in answer to this claim. He is the French Hogarth, whether he paints
in sombre colours the misery that the drunkard brings upon his family, and
the horrors of poverty, or depicts in brighter tones the love of children for
their parents and the works of charity; and with him too, as with the Englishman,
his title was chosen with a didactic after-thought to heighten the effect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>61</span>
of his picture. Thus such scenes as these occurred: &ldquo;The Father&rsquo;s Curse,&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Consolation of Age,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Son&rsquo;s Correction,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Ungrateful Son,&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Beloved Mother,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Spoilt Child,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Lame Man tended by his
Relations,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Results of Good Education.&rdquo; He had this, too, in
common with Hogarth: he liked to develop his moral stories in long series,
which invariably ended with the triumph of virtue and the punishment of
vice. The didactic story of <i>Bazile et Thibaut</i> attempted to relate in twenty-six
chapters the influence of a good education on the formation of a whole
life; and, just as in Hogarth&rsquo;s story of the two apprentices, here too, at the
conclusion, the well-educated Thibaut pronounces sentence of death over
his old friend Bazile, the badly educated, and now condemned murderer.
The fact that in other things the two moral apostles differ greatly from each
other is accounted for by the difference in the national characteristics of those
to whom they variously appealed.</p>

<p>Hogarth <i>scourged</i> the vices of the Third Estate in order to raise them
to morality. Rape, bloodshed, debauchery, disorderliness, gluttony, and
drunkenness&mdash;that was the channel through which in England at that day the
furious flood of the uncontrolled spirit of the populace poured itself, foaming
and raging with fearful natural force. Hogarth swung over these human
animals the stout cudgel of morality in the manner of a sturdy policeman
and Puritan <i>bourgeois</i>. With such people a delicate forbearance would have
been misplaced. At the foot of every prison-scene he inscribed the name of the
vice that he had pilloried there, and subjoined the predicted damnation from
Holy Writ. He reveals it in its hideousness, he steeps it in its filth, traces
it to its retribution, so that even the
most vitiated conscience must recognise
it and the most hardened abhor it.</p>

<p>Greuze employs the Third Estate as
a <i>mirror of virtue</i>, sets forth its noble
qualities as an edification to an aristocracy
that has grown vicious. Less
primitive and, for that very reason, less
original than Hogarth, he never forgets
that he lives in the most refined social
period in history. He does not strangle
his culprits to provide terrifying examples,
but nearly always leaves a corner
open for repentance. He knew that he
dared not exact too much from the
nerves of his noble public; he merely
wished to stir them to a soft vibration.
He did not paint for drunken English
people, but for those perfumed marquises
who, later on, bowed with so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>62</span>
courtly an elegance before the guillotine; for those sensitive ladies in
whom virtue now excited the same sensual delight that vice had done
before. They welcomed in him the high priest of a sort of orgie of virtue,
to whose festivals they had grown reconciled.
The century which in its
first half had danced as light-heartedly
as any other the can-can of life,
becomes, in its second half, sad of
soul, enthusiastic over the reward of
justice, the punishment of transgressors,
over honour and the naïveté of innocence.
Time after time do his contemporaries
praise precisely that
sense of virtue in the art of Greuze.
So that in France, as in England,
the burden of interest was laid no
longer upon the art, but upon an
accessory circumstance. For since, in
the hands of Greuze, the picture had
been turned into an argument, in
France, as in England, art ceased to
be an end&mdash;it became only a means.
He made painting a didactic poem, the
more melodramatic the better, and was driven thereby on the same sandbank
upon which Hogarth, and all <i>genre</i> painters who <i>would be</i> more than painters,
have made shipwreck. In order to bring out his story with the utmost
possible distinctness, he was too frequently compelled unduly to accentuate
his point. The effect became affected, the pathos theatrical. His picture
of the &ldquo;Father&rsquo;s Curse&rdquo; in the Louvre, with the infuriated old man, the son
hurrying wildly away, and the weeping sisters, resembles the last act of a
melodrama. &ldquo;The Country Wedding,&rdquo; where the father-in-law has given
the young bridegroom the purse with the dowry, and now pathetically
observes, &ldquo;Take it, and be happy,&rdquo; might just as well have been entitled &ldquo;The
Father&rsquo;s Last Blessing.&rdquo; In the picture in which a noble dame takes her
daughter to the bedside of two poor persons who are ill, to accustom her
in early life to works of charity, the personages in the picture, arranged
exactly as if upon a stage, must have been themselves uncommonly
moved by the touching and praiseworthy action. Greuze was the father
of <i>genre</i> painting in France&mdash;that barbaric, story-telling art which replaced
<i>tableaux vivants</i> based upon the literary idea by the Dutchmen&rsquo;s picturesque
and well-observed selections from nature. Beyond that, however, it must
not be forgotten that he, like Hogarth, psychologically opposed to the earlier
art, showed practical progress in many of his works. There were few in
French art before him who depicted the emotions of the soul with such refinement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>63</span>
as Greuze in his &ldquo;Reading of the Bible.&rdquo; In proportion to the understanding
and character of the individual is the impression of the listener
reflected on his countenance. That was something new in comparison with
the laughing gods of Boucher. And that Greuze was also capable of the most
highly <i>pictorial</i> magic when he could once bring himself to lay aside the moral
teacher is proved by his rosy, inspired heads of young girls. He never grew
weary of painting these pretty children in every situation and attitude at
that seductive age which hides the charming feet beneath the first long gown.
Blonde or brunette, with a blue ribbon in the hair, a little cluster of flowers
in the bodice, they gaze out upon life with their big, brown child eyes, full
of curiosity and misgiving. A light gauze covers the soft lines of the neck,
the shoulders are as yet hardly rounded, the pouting lips are fresh as the
morning dew, and only the two rosy, budding breasts, that fight lustily against
their imprisonment, and seem, like Sterne&rsquo;s starling, to cry, &ldquo;I cannot get
out,&rdquo; betray that the woman is already awake in the child. Greuze&rsquo;s name
will always be associated with these girl types, just as that of Leonardo is
with the dreamy, smiling sphinx-like head of Mona Lisa. In them he has
given an unsurpassable expression to the ideal of innocence at the end of the
eighteenth century, and provided in them a new thrill of beauty for his contemporaries.
And a <i>blasé</i> society which had indulged in every licence bathed
itself with passionate delight in the unknown mystery of this surging flood.
Yes, after the stimulating champagne of <i>rococo</i>, people had even come to
delight in simple black bread. And so, out of <i>bourgeoisie</i> itself, a school of
painting was developed as fresh and healthy as this.</p>

<p><i>Chardin</i>, the carpenter&rsquo;s son, is at the head of this domestic art in the
eighteenth century. After Greuze, the painter of refined taste, he seems,
a comfortable, healthy, <i>bourgeois</i> master in
whom the Dutchman of the best period once
more appears upon earth.</p>

<p>After the king had, up to the close of the
seventeenth century, been the centre round
which everything turned, the solitary personality
which dared to appear independent,
and upon which the rest of the world formed
itself; after the circles round the court had
next freed themselves, and gained the right
to enjoy life and art for themselves, there
still remained a third step to surmount.
&ldquo;Society&rdquo; abdicates in favour of a free and
healthy <i>bourgeoisie</i>.</p>

<p>A surgeon&rsquo;s sign was the first work which
brought the young man, who had received
no systematic education, into notice. The
surgeon is in his shop attending to a man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>64</span>
who has been wounded in a duel, grouped around are curious bystanders, while
the commissary of police investigates the case with a grave countenance. It
is the first picture of the Parisian life of the people. And Chardin, with
his middle-class origin, remained the advocate of middle-class domestic life.
He is the Watteau of the Third Estate. Greuze owes his success, in the
first place, to the ingenious manner in which he made himself the spokesman
of the moral tendency of his age. It interested contemporary society
to be told that it is beautiful to see married folk live together in happiness;
that young mothers do a good action in nursing their children, when
it is possible, themselves; that man should repent of his sins; and that he
who honours his father and mother lives long in the land. Nowadays we
thank him for these wise counsels, but say, at the same time, that we could
have done without them. We no longer see the necessity of illustrating
the ten commandments, and notice now all the more the mannerisms,
the rhetorical strokes of advocacy which the painter must employ in order
to plead successfully. Chardin&rsquo;s effect is as fresh to-day as it was a
hundred years ago, because he was a sheer artist, who did not seek to tell
a story, but only to represent,&mdash;a realist of the finest stamp, belonging in his
exquisite sense of colour values to the illustrious family of the Terburgs.
His pictures have no &ldquo;purpose.&rdquo; The washerwoman, the woman scraping
carrots, the housewife at her manifold tasks&mdash;that is Chardin&rsquo;s world; the
atmosphere in which these figures move, the shimmering light that floats in
the half-dark kitchen, the wealth of sun-rays that play upon the white tablecloths
and brown-panelled walls&mdash;those are his fields of study. Chardin
lived in an old studio, high up near the roof, a quiet, dark room that was usually
full of vegetables which he used for his &ldquo;still life.&rdquo; There was something
picturesque about the dusty walls where the moist green of vegetables mingled
so harmoniously with the time-worn, sombre brown of the wainscoting, and
the white table-cloth was flooded with the silvery green which poured
in from a little skylight. In this peaceful and harmoniously toned chamber
were laid those small domestic scenes, which he so loved to paint, and which
were called by the French, in contrast to the <i>Fétes Galantes</i>, &ldquo;<i>Amusements
de la Vie Privée</i>.&rdquo; The clock ticks, the lamp burns, water is boiling on the
homely tiled stove. There is an effect in every one of his pictures, as
though he had lived them himself, as if they were reminiscences of something
dear to him and familiar. In contrast to Greuze he shunned all
critical moments, and depicted only the quiet life of custom, everyday life
as it befell in a constant, regular routine. There are no hasty movements
with him, no catastrophes nor complications; he has a preference for
&ldquo;still life&rdquo; in the world of men, just as in nature. He is <i>par excellence</i>
the painter of <i>Intimität</i> (intimate life); which is not the same as <i>a genre</i>
painter. Painters who in the manner of <i>genre</i> have depicted domestic
scenes in rooms are to be found in every school; but how few have known
how to depict the poetry of the family life with such truth, with such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>65</span>
an absence of affectation and insipidity! With Chardin art and life are
interfused.</p>

<p>No Dutchman, however, had penetrated into the nursery. Chardin, in
surprising the child-world
at their games, in
their joys and sorrows,
has opened out to art
a new province. And
with what affectionate
devotion has he not
absorbed himself in the
spirit of the little people!
I know of no one before
him who has painted
the unconscious spiritual
life of the child with
such discreet tenderness:
the little hands that
grasp at something, the
lips that a mother would
like to kiss, the dreamy
wide-open young eyes.
In this Chardin is a
master. It is not only
obvious expressions of
joy and sorrow, but
those refined shades, so
difficult to seize, of observation,
thoughtfulness,
consideration, calm
reflection, quaintness,
obstinacy or sulking, which he analyses in the eyes of the child.
There is the little girl playing with her doll, and lavishing on her all
the love and care of a tender mother. There is an elderly, half-grown-up
little lady teaching her younger brother the mysteries of the alphabet.
Then come the games and the tasks. They build card-houses, blow bubbles,
or are wholly engrossed in their drawing-books and home-lessons. How
attentive the little girl is whose mother has just given her her first
embroidery materials. How charmingly embarrassed is the small boy whom
she hears his lesson. And what trouble she takes in the morning, that
her darling shall be clean and tidy when he goes to school. In one
picture the cap on the little girl&rsquo;s head is crooked, and her mother is
putting it straight, whilst the child with a pretty pride is peeping curiously
in the glass. Again, there is the boy just saying good-bye. He is neat and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>66</span>
well combed; his playthings, too, have been nicely tidied up, and his books
are under his arm. His mother takes his three-cornered hat off again in
order to brush it properly. When school is over, you see them sitting at
dinner. The table is laid with a
snow-white cloth, and the cook is
just bringing in a steaming dish.
It is touching to see how prettily
the small boy clasps his hands
and says his grace. And when
they are again off to afternoon
school the mother sits alone.
She looks charming in her simple
house-dress, with the loose sleeves,
her clean white apron and kerchief,
her striped petticoat and
coquettish cap. Soon she takes
her embroidery on her lap and
stoops forward to take a ball of
wool out of her basket. Next
she sits before the fire in a cosy
corner against a folding screen.
A half-opened book rests in her
hand, a tea-cup stands close by,
a homely atmosphere of the living
room hovers round her. Then,
like a true housewife, she takes
up her house-keeping book, or goes into the kitchen to help the cook,
while she scrapes carrots or scrubs the cooking utensils or brings in
the meat from the larder. It is all rendered with such truth and simplicity
that one acquires an affection for Chardin, who with his art got to the
root of family life and bestowed upon it the subtlest gifts of observation
and generous comprehension, while none the less his domesticity never
became commonplace.</p>

<p>His contemporary, <i>Étienne Jeurat</i>, painted scenes at country fairs, and
<i>Jean Baptiste le Prince</i> pictures of guardrooms and similar subjects. In
Holland <i>Cornelis Troost</i> went on parallel lines with him. He depicted
the life of his age and of his nation&mdash;comic scenes, banquets, weddings,
and the like&mdash;in pastels or water colours, and that without seeking
inspiration from any of the Dutch classics, but with a vivid, intelligent
comprehension. Even Italian art ended in two &ldquo;<i>genre</i> painters,&rdquo; the
Venetians Rotari and Pietro Longhi, who have bequeathed to us such
charming little pictures of the life of that age&mdash;fortune-tellers, dancing-masters,
tailors, apothecaries, little boys and girls at play or at their
tasks.</p>

<p>Germany presented no such great manifestation as Chardin, although
there too the tendency was the same. There too, after the devastation of
the Thirty Years&rsquo; War, a moral, active <i>bourgeoisie</i> had at last sprung up
that was prepared to take up the line which had been already laid down by
the English. Lessing was the first in this magnificent struggle for evolution.
He wrote, in his <i>Miss Sarah Sampson</i>, the first German tragedy without the
support of great mythical or historical heroes, and without the stiff ponderousness
of the Alexandrine. He declared, like Moore, that helmets and
diadems do not make tragic heroes; he even in his <i>Minna</i> set vividly
before the eyes of his contemporaries something in the immediate present,
the Seven Years&rsquo; War. And just as Lessing liberated the German drama
from the jurisdiction of Boileau, so art began to mutiny against the classicism
which had come in through the medium of France, and which had been inherited
from the age when it was the pride of German courts to be small
copies of Versailles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How exceedingly abhorrent to me are our berouged puppet painters,&rdquo;
cries the young Goethe, in his essay on German style and art, &ldquo;I could not
sufficiently protest; they have caught the eyes of the women with theatrical
poses, false complexions, and gaudy costumes; the wood engravings of manly
old Albrecht Dürer, at whom tyros scoff, are more welcome to me.... Only
where intimacy and simplicity exist is all artistic vigour to be found, and woe to
the artist who leaves his hut to squander himself in academic halls of state.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Daniel Chodowiecki</i>, with all his commonplaceness, is a genuine expression
of this phase of German art. He in Germany, Hogarth in England, and
Chardin in France, are products of the same tendency of the age. After
Lessing had produced in <i>Minna</i> the first domestic German tragedy, Chodowiecki,
following the road of Hogarth and Chardin, was able to become the
painter of the German middle class. He is not a master of such penetrating
strength as they were, but he is no less an artist of notable merit. He is
certainly no genius&mdash;in fact almost a handicraftsman, sober and philistine,
but, like Hogarth, a self-made man who in his whole artistic and
personal outlook was rooted in the soil of his city and of his age. Berlin
society of that day
was the basis of his art,
the daily life of house
and street his domain.
He began by illustrating
poems and depicting
scenes out of the <i>Seven
Years&rsquo; War</i> and the
<i>History of Charles the
Great</i>, and went on from
that to the pleasant,
homely life of the small
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>69</span>
<i>bourgeoisie</i>. Himself of the middle classes, he chiefly worked for them, and
with his sensitive and dexterous graving tool he kept the liveliest and most
exhaustive chronicle of the German <i>bourgeoisie</i> of that age. At times almost
too reasonable and prosaic, a genuine Nicolai, he has in other plates an
enchanting freshness, and&mdash;which should not be forgotten&mdash;is more of an
artist than Hogarth, since he is neither moralist nor satirist. His object,
without any moral after-thought, was the true and kindly observation of life
as displayed in the world around him. He took the wholly naïve delight of
the genuine artist in turning everything he saw into a picture. These
chronicles of his have some, it may be but a particle, of the spirit of Dürer.
Simultaneously, the young <i>Tischbein</i> delved into the past of the nation, the
age of Conradin and the Hohenstaufen, with the intention of finding there
the simplicity which the academic pictures had come to lack; and, later on,
he painted in Hamburg extremely realistic historical pictures of his own period,
such as that which is to be found in the Oldenburg Gallery: &ldquo;Entry of General
Benigsen into Hamburg, 1814.&rdquo; He did good work too as a portrait painter.
In his best picture, &ldquo;Goethe amongst the Ruins of Rome,&rdquo; the head of the
poet is energetic and full of strength, the colouring of an excellent clear
grey.</p>

<p>In portrait painting in general, the revolution is reflected with especial
clearness. The artificial manner that had been copied from the seventeenth
century, the age of long perukes, gives way, slowly but surely, to an ever-growing
naturalness, simplicity, and originality. At that time, while the
spirit of Louis <span class="sc">XIV</span> still hovered over everything, the passion of the individual
to be king in his own sphere had penetrated into the family. The honest
citizen, therefore, would not let himself be painted as such, but only as a
prince,&mdash;he, himself, in gala dress, with a pompous air, as stately as though
he were giving an audience to the spectator, his wife in silk and gold
and lace; she has a great mantle of state worn loose over her shoulders
and hips, and looks down with an assumption of grandeur on her grandchild,
who is half respectful and half inclined to make fun. The frame is as
rich as the costume, and probably bears a crown. We are with difficulty
persuaded that these are
pictures of simple citizens,
that the man, apart
from the hours during
which he sat to the
painter, is an industrious
tradesman, and the wife,
glancing out so haughtily,
most probably darned his
stockings. Their portraits
seem to form part
of an ancestral gallery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>70</span></p>

<p>This age of princely state was followed by that of fraternity. In place
of berouged and postured portraits with allegorical accessories, there appeared
simple, unpretentious likenesses of human beings in their work-a-day
clothes; in place of stiff attitudes, <i>genre</i> motives with the easy naturalness
of everyday life.</p>

centre of artistic life, and in his works the revolution may be traced. Something
familiar and intimate takes the place of that stately pomp. The princes,
hitherto, had liked to be represented in mediæval armour or antique equipment;
Pesne painted them in the costume of the time. And in his portraits
of his friends and his family circle he has been still more unconstrained. There
is the charming picture of 1718, in the New Palace at Potsdam, which shows
the painter himself with his wife and his two children; the portrait of Schmidt
the engraver, in the Berlin Museum; and the beautiful picture of 1754 in
the collection of Colonel Von Berke, at Schemnitz, which depicts him again
at the age of seventy-one with his two daughters. Pesne is revealed in these
characteristic portraits, as well as in his character pictures in the Dresden
Gallery (&ldquo;The Girl with the Pigeons,&rdquo; 1728, &ldquo;The Cook with the Turkey-hen,&rdquo;
1712), as a thoroughly sane and strong realist, of a kind which became
almost extinct in Berlin a hundred years later.</p>

<p>In the next generation, in the <i>Sturm-und-Drang</i> period, <i>Anton Graff</i>,
the Swiss, took the lead with his simple, domestic, honest, real portraits.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>71</span>
It was a happy disposition of fate that Graff&rsquo;s activity just corresponded with
the great period of the awakening of intellectual life in Germany, that Lessing
and Schiller, Bodmer and Gessner, Wieland and Herder, Bürger and Gellert,
Christian Gottfried Körner and Lippert, Moses Mendelssohn and Sulzer, and a
long succession of other poets and scholars of the eighteenth and the beginning
of the nineteenth century, found in him a portrait painter whose quick and
agile hand left us their features in the truest and most authentic manner.
What and how robust his art is, how clear and plastic the execution of the
heads, how adroit and infallible the technique!</p>

<p>Besides Graff, there worked in Dresden <i>Christian Leberecht Vogel</i>, likewise
a most independent, picturesque, and sensitive artist, who, if only for his
pictures of children, deserves a place of honour in the history of art in the
eighteenth century. In the portrait of his two boys, in the Dresden Gallery,
the naïveté of child-life is observed with such tenderness and rendered with
such vigour as only Reynolds understood. The boys are sitting close together
on the ground. One, in a brown frock, is holding a book on his knees, which
the other, in a red frock, with a whip in his hand, is looking at. The thoughtful
expression of the little ones is quite charming; the execution broad and
strong, the colour treatment delightful and tender.</p>

<p>In Munich lived the excellent <i>Johann Edlinger</i>, the most industrious of
these sturdy masters, who were so modest and yet so capable.</p>

<p>In the domain of landscape the Continent produced no one who could
be compared with Gainsborough; but here, too, the English influence made
itself felt. It can be traced how the same feeling for nature which had given
birth to Thomson&rsquo;s <i>Seasons</i> and Gainsborough&rsquo;s landscapes, afterwards found
expression in France and Germany, and dissipated the prevailing taste in
gardens. The seventeenth century&mdash;with the exception of the Dutch&mdash;had
set nature in order with the garden shears. As Lebrun in his historical
compositions endeavoured to outdo the Italians, so Lenôtre&rsquo;s garden style
exemplified the perfection and exaggeration of the gardens of the Italian
Renaissance, which themselves again were laid out on the plan of the
old Roman gardens from existing descriptions. A garden reminded one more
of state apartments, which one could only walk through with measured steps,
quietly and respectfully, than of nature, where one is, and dares to be, human.
Corresponding to this formally planned, correctly measured style of garden
there was a school of landscape which improved nature on &ldquo;artistic&rdquo; principles,
and, by the arrangement of bits of nature, produced a world peculiarly
full of style. Landscapes
were nicely laid-out parks,
which, like the figure pictures,
made for an abstract beauty
of mass and lines, and which,
by means of accessories, such
as classical ruins, would turn
one&rsquo;s thought to the ancient
world. Nature must not,
as Batteux taught, be the
instructor of the artist,
but the artist must select
the parts and build up
his picture. Out of many
leaves he takes only the
most perfectly developed,
puts only such perfect leaves
on one tree, and so obtains
a perfect tree. Let the
essential of his production
be <i>nature choisie</i>, a selection
of objects that &ldquo;are capable
of producing agreeable
impressions&rdquo;; his aim &ldquo;<i>le
beau vrai qui est représenté
comme s&rsquo;il existait réellement
et avec toutes les perfections
qu&rsquo;il peut recevoir</i>.&rdquo; The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>73</span>
eighteenth century went back from this &ldquo;noble,&rdquo; improved nature,
step by step to the divine beauty of unimproved nature; just as those
masters untouched by the Romans, Dürer and Altdorfer, Titian and
Rubens, Brouwer and Velasquez, had painted her. The great Watteau, too,
was here for the most part in advance of his age, in that, instead of
the stiffly designed stage scenery of Poussin, he gave Elysian landscapes,&mdash;abodes
of love, that now glisten in the sunshine of the young morning,
now are suffused with golden light and the misty shadows of the evening
twilight. The rose in her young bud is odorous, the nightingale sings,
the doves coo, the light boughs whisper to the soft west wind, bright silver
rivulets ripple, the wind sighs through the tall branches. Watteau knew
nature and loved her, and rendered her in her transparent beauty with the
intoxicated eyes of a lover. The spirit of nature, not of humanity, dominates
in his pictures. It is only because nature is so lovely that man is so
happy.</p>

<p>But still more modern is the effect, when instead of painting Elysian landscapes
with happy inhabitants, he drew mere bits of rural nature, poor solitary
regions in the neighbourhood of big towns, where bricklayers are working
on the scaffolding of some house, or peasants are riding with their horses
over some stony byway. Out of a number of spirited drawings, this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>74</span>
side of his perception in landscape is especially notable in the picture in
the New Palace at Potsdam, in the left background of which a small stream
flows past a farmhouse, whilst in front a peasant is laboriously dragging a two-wheeled
cart over the rough ground.</p>

<p>It is interesting to observe, at that time, after Watteau and his
English predecessors, the widespread growth of this new feeling for
nature. Thomson was followed by Rousseau, who, on his lonely wanderings,
looked with moved eyes at &ldquo;the gold of the corn crop, the purple of the
heather, the majesty of the trees, and the wonderful variety of flowers and
grasses.&rdquo; He delighted in the blossoming of spring, the copses and rivulets,
the song of birds, shady woods, and the landscapes of autumn, where the
reapers and vine-dressers were working. He is the author of that lively
feeling for nature that henceforth was aroused through the whole of Europe.
A breath of pure mountain air, a wholesome draught of fresh water from Lake
Leman, were brought suddenly into the sultry atmosphere of salons, and filled
people&rsquo;s hearts with a new and charming sensation when Rousseau&rsquo;s works
appeared. It was over with all efforts of &ldquo;stylists&rdquo; as soon as Rousseau
declared that everything was good just as it came out of the lap of the universal
mother, nature.</p>

<p>Goethe, the pupil of Rousseau, presages, in his whole conception of nature,
something of the manifestation of the school of Fontainebleau. He had
something of Daubigny when, as Werther, he lies on the bank of the stream
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>75</span>
and looks down thoughtfully at the worms and small insects. He makes
one think of Dupré or Corot when he says: &ldquo;As nature declines upon autumn,
within me and around me it grows autumn&rdquo;; or, &ldquo;I could not now draw
so much as a stroke, and I have never been a greater painter than at the
present moment&rdquo;; or, &ldquo;Never have I been happier, nor has my perception
of nature, down to the pebble or the grass beneath me, been fuller and more
intimate. Yet,&mdash;I know not how I can express myself, everything swims
and oscillates before my soul, so that I can seize no outline. A great, shadowy
whole waves before my soul, my perception grows indistinct before it, even
as my eyes do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus were the French gardens delivered by the English. Just as figure
painting renounced lofty, architectural, formal composition, so those bisected
and upholstered gardens were supplanted by irregular and, as it were, accidental
bits of nature. People took no more trouble, in Rousseau&rsquo;s phrase,
&ldquo;to dishonour nature by seeking to beautify her,&rdquo; but laid out gardens in
harmony with Goethe&rsquo;s remark in <i>Werther</i>: &ldquo;A feeling heart, not a scientific
art of gardening, suggested the plan.&rdquo; Close to Versailles, near the box-tree
patterns of Lenôtre, lay the Petit Trianon, with its pond, its brook, and its
dairy, where the unfortunate Marie Antoinette used to dream. And if
painting still loitered on its preliminary return to nature, that only implied
that the great artists&mdash;they only came in 1830!&mdash;were not yet born. Great
artists can only raise themselves on the shoulders of their predecessors, whose
value lies in their utility. The French landscapes of the eighteenth century,
seen in the light of historical development, are of no importance; but, nevertheless,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>76</span>
they gave a considerable stimulus in that they sought to animate
the style of Poussin with a closer perception of nature. Hubert Robert is
certainly strongly decorative, but he has a light touch; one cannot take him at
his word, but he is intelligent, and has sometimes grey and green tones that are
soft and beautiful. Joseph Vernet painted coast scenery, views of harbours,
storms at sea, likewise with decorative, superficial effects of light; he let flashes
of lightning streak black clouds, sun-rays dance over lightly ruffled waves,
silver moonshine play mysteriously upon the water, and caused conflagrations
to break out and red flames to shoot up to heaven. He is somewhat inane
and motley in his colouring. But he had ceased to see in the parts of nature
nothing but materials for the construction of nicely fitting scenery. He no
longer attempted to speak to the reason by means of lines, but to touch the
soul through humour, and he employed in his scenery not only buildings
and ruins, gods and ancient shepherds, but also modern groups of every kind.</p>

<p>In Switzerland, the charming etchings and water-colours of <i>Solomon
Gessner</i> must be especially mentioned. Ludwig Richter, indeed, pointed
them out as the eighteenth century works which, after the engravings of
Chodowiecki, he loved the best. Gessner venerated Claude, and had an
enthusiasm for Poussin, but his pictures have no traces of the lofty style
of the heroic school of landscape. He sketched his native meadows, trees,
and brooks; he loved all that was small and secluded and cosy, arbours and
hedges, quiet little gardens and idyllic nooks. He approached everything
with a very childlike and faithful observation of nature. A second Swiss,
Ludwig Hess, dedicated a similar subtile sense of nature and loving zeal as
much to his native Switzerland as to the Roman Campagna.</p>

<p>The German <i>Philip Hackert</i> has been prejudiced rather than profited by
the monument which Goethe erected
to him. As Goethe&rsquo;s enthusiasm was
not in due proportion with Hackert&rsquo;s
importance, he ceased later to attract
attention, though this he did not
merit, as he was always a vigorous
and healthy landscape painter. He
did not see nature with the tender
sensibility of the Swiss. He looked
at a landscape somewhat insipidly, as
Chodowiecki at his models. But his
drawing is sober, the atmosphere of his
pictures clear and fresh; he cannot
be tedious in his composition. In
Dresden there lived Johann Alexander
Thiele, who roamed through Thüringen
and Mecklenburg as a landscape
painter. Even in Italy landscapes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>77</span>
were the most independent performances which the eighteenth century
had brought forth there. There worked in Rome the Netherlander,
Vanvitelli, who depicted in graceful water-colours Roman and Neapolitan
street life; and Giovanni Paolo Pannini, the <i>peintre des fêtes publiques</i>,
in whose pictures groups of richly coloured figures moved through splendid
palaces. Venice was the home of the Canaletti. In <i>Antonio Canale&rsquo;s</i>
town pictures of Venice, Rome, and London there is at once so subtle
an atmospheric movement, the water is so clear, the air so transparent,
that even if they represent mere streets and buildings, they yet leave an
impression of landscape achieved in a broad, pictorial method. <i>Bernardo
Canaletto</i> produces an effect by the fine, cool, damp light of his northern
studies even simpler and more intimate, while by his discovery that
sunshine does not&mdash;as it was hitherto believed&mdash;gild but silver the object
it falls on, he became one of the fathers of realistic landscape. The
most ingenious, however, of the school of Canale, not to say one of the
cleverest landscape painters of the century, was <i>Francesco Guardi</i>. Antonio
Canale was a great artist, and shows it never better than in his distinguished
etchings, but as a painter he interests the collector more than the connoisseur.
There his qualities are too often petrified into an excessive formality; he
shows something too much of the <i>camera obscura</i>. Guardi is ingenious and
startling. Where you have accuracy in Canale, in him you find spirit. Canale
shows us the real Venice, Guardi shows it as we have dreamed it to be. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>78</span>
has not Canale&rsquo;s knowledge of perspective and architecture, but he fascinates
us. He is a musician and a poet whose palette resounds with the purest
harmonies. In his pictures the whole seductive legend of the fallen Queen
of the Adriatic abides. Garlanded gondolas glide peaceful and fairy-like,
majestic as vessels in some distant wonderland, over the clear, green water
of the canals, beneath the high, marble palaces, which mirror their columns
and balconies, their arches and their loggias in the stream. Foreign ambassadors
pass in great state through the Piazza di San Marco; all that proud, Venetian
nobility greets them; and thick throngs of people in their Sunday attire move
to and fro beneath the Hall of the Procuration. Gay bands of musicians
row along the Piazzetta and the Riva. A moist breeze sweeps over the water;
the sunshine, now subdued and mellow, now dancing coquettishly, plays
upon the water or on the houses. Francesco Guardi, the magician of Venice,
is an animated, exquisite, always ingenious <i>improvisatore</i>, strong as few
others are in the direct transference of his personal impression to canvas.
Every stroke of his brush takes effect,&mdash;in each one of his pictures one sees
the nervous exaltation of the hand; and that gives him a power of attraction
which, compared with Canale, is like that of the clay model, in which the
hand of the sculptor is still perceptible, compared with the cold, marble
statue.</p>

<p>Even Spain, which, except for the colossal figure of Velasquez, had so
far produced no painters of landscape&mdash;even Spain, after the middle of the
century, turned into this road. <i>Don Pedro Rodriguez de Miranda</i> painted his
broad, clear, and vigorously observed highland studies; <i>Don Mariano Ramon
Sanchez</i> his small views of towns and harbours.</p>

<p>And, as in England, hand in hand with that came paintings of animals.</p>

<p>In France, <i>François Canova</i> was working, the painter of huge battle scenes
and small pictures of animals; <i>Jean Louis de Marne</i>, who was famous for his
cattle, market scenes, village pictures, and the like; and the great <i>Jean
Baptiste Oudry</i>, who painted with breadth and freedom animals alive and dead,
wild and tame, still-life of every kind. In Augsburg lived <i>Johann Elias
Riedinger</i>, whose field of activity embraced the entire animal world, dogs and
horses, stags and roes, wild boars, chamois, bears, lions, tigers, elephants,
and the hippopotamus&mdash;which he depicted with fine observation, both in their
proud solitude and at strife with men.</p>

<p>If we cast one more glance back to the road which art had travelled since
the commencement of the century, we can have no doubt as to the end which
was proportionately aimed at in all countries. Until quite recently a courtly,
aristocratic art had shed its light upon the whole of Europe. In the seventeenth
century the Dutch alone had maintained their isolation. They who
entered fresh into art, and had to break with no tradition, gave at that time
the first expression to the new spirit, in that they resolutely recalled art from
its courtly surroundings to the humbler dwellings of the middle classes.
They <i>painted</i> what Dürer and the &ldquo;little masters&rdquo; had only graved upon wood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>79</span>
blocks and copper plates. Still, they wished to paint these things less for
their own sakes than because so intimate a light was shed upon them. Through
elements of light they contrived to cast over everyday moments a sort of fairy
inspiration. Watteau and his successors made a further advance in the
conquest of the visible world, in that they desired to paint their age, for its
own sake, in all its grace; and by the middle of the century we find this new,
intimate, familiar art, independent of ancient tradition, triumphing all along
the line. &ldquo;Sublime&rdquo; painting is more and more forsaken. Art becomes
more and more indigenous to her world and age. Aristocratic Watteau is
succeeded by Hogarth, Greuze, Chardin, and Chodowiecki, who treat the
Third Estate no longer in the Dutch <i>chiaroscuro</i>, but in all its heavy reality
as a valid object of art. Instead of that lofty, majestic, vainglorious painting
of mere representations, which was the outcome of Cinquecento, and which
at the expiration of the seventeenth century had sunk, through abstraction,
into something uniform, trivial, and tedious, there appeared on all sides
an art which was simple and sincere, which plunged into the life of every day,
observed man in his relations with nature, with his fellows, with his faithful
animals, and with his household goods&mdash;an art which created the variety of
its representations out of its own experience. So with landscape, the most
modern branch of art; it reached in the schools of all nations a greater significance&mdash;at
least, in extent&mdash;than it had ever possessed in the history of art.
And this development proceeded without its being established that any one
country had direct influence on any other. The ideas hung in the atmosphere;
they were the ideas of the century. It is as though the departing age would
hold a mirror before us&mdash;a magic mirror&mdash;which foretells the future; as
though it would point out that nineteenth century art, advancing further
along this road, should be domestic-human, and that it should find in landscape
its most appropriate expression.</p>

<p>It was not given to painting to proceed straight forward in this course,
for through favour, partly of the changed current of literature, partly of the
revolution, the flame of reactionary classicism shot up brightly once more
before it expired.</p>

<p class="center chap">CHAPTER III</p>

<p class="center chap2">THE CLASSICAL REACTION IN GERMANY</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">A hundred</span> years ago there lived a man of the name of Asmus Carstens;
and he was the pioneer and founder of the new German art. That
has become since Fernow a standing maxim in manuals of the history of art.
Dilettantism, however, is not an element, but an end. It is on this account,
therefore, that later times will see in Carstens, not a pioneer, but only one of
the close followers of that tendency of which the founders were the brothers
Caracci, and the offshoots Lebrun, Lairesse, and Van der Werff. It is, at all
events, historically clear that Hogarth and Gainsborough, Watteau, Greuze,
Chardin, and Goya were the men to whom the future belonged. Their art
survived the overthrow of the Classicalism represented by Mengs and Carstens,
which, through external circumstances, once more got the upper hand for a
short time, and it became the foundation on which, after the disappearance
of this tendency inherited from the past, the moderns built further. The
former represented progress, because they moved forwards; Carstens and
David, reaction, because they looked backwards&mdash;backwards to an age
which had long ago been buried.</p>

<p>There is always danger to a living art in the contact with any great art of
the past. Only those who are themselves highly gifted may hope to emulate
the great ones of the earlier centuries; lesser geniuses perish in the attempt.
Painters like Leonardo and Raphael, like Titian and Poussin, taking the
Greeks as their masters, produced immortal works, and Goethe and Schiller
proved to us that the Hellenic spirit is still alive and active in our midst. But
would anyone dare to mention Mengs and Carstens in the same breath with
these giants?</p>

<p>The close of the eighteenth century was a period of antiquarian revival.
The ruins of Pæstum had been brought to light, Greek vases and Roman
monuments had become known to the public by the works of Hamilton and
Piranesi. In 1762 Stuart and Revett published their splendid work on the
<i>Antiquities of Athens</i>. To a German, however, was to fall the honour of
becoming the hero of the archæological period. The <i>History of Ancient Art</i>,
by Johann Joachim Winckelmann, appeared in 1764, and this writer devoted
his literary energies to the hymning of the glories of the re-discovered treasures
of antiquity. In the realm of pictorial art he may also be looked upon as the
chosen of fate. Already, nine years before the appearance of his <i>History of</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81"></a>81</span>
<i>Art</i>, he had given, at the age of thirty-eight, his first writing to the world,
<i>Thoughts upon the Imitation of Greek Works</i>, in which the reformation motive
is epitomised in this sentence: &ldquo;The sole means for us to become&mdash;ay, if
possible, inimitably great&mdash;is the imitation of the ancients.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From Winckelmann the stone kept on rolling. &ldquo;In Greek sculpture the
painter can attain to the most sublime conception of beauty, and learn what
he must lend to nature in order to give dignity and propriety to his imitation,&rdquo;
writes Solomon Gessner in 1759. In 1762 Hagedorn of Dresden deplored, in
his <i>Treatise on Painting</i>, that &ldquo;Terburg and Metsu never showed us fair Andromache
amongst her industrious women, instead of Dutch sempstresses.&rdquo; In
1766 Lessing wrote his <i>Laocoön</i>, and, like Winckelmann, saw in the sculpture
of the Greeks the ideal to be imitated. From this point forward he despised
landscape and <i>genre</i> painting, and especially everything which illustrates intimate
emotions and actions, and would confine the composition of pictures to
an arrangement of two or three &ldquo;ideal figures which please by physical beauty.&rdquo;
Soon afterwards, with almost astonishing partiality, Goethe intervened in a
notable manner on behalf of Classicism with the most flagrant contradiction
of the ideas of his youth. &ldquo;Nature alone,&rdquo; he had said in <i>Werther</i>, &ldquo;makes
the great artist&rdquo;; and in his essay upon <i>German Method and Art</i> he aimed
this sentence at Winckelmann and his followers: &ldquo;You yourselves, admirable
beings, to whom it was given to enjoy the highest beauty, you are hurtful to
genius; it will be raised up and borne along on no strange wings, were they
even the wings of the dawn.&rdquo; In the same essay occurs the beautiful passage:
&ldquo;If art is produced out of an inward, single, independent conception, untroubled
by, unconscious indeed, of, all that is extraneous, then whether she be
born of rough wildness or of cultivated sensibility, she is complete and living.&rdquo;
Soon afterwards he wrote again these great words: &ldquo;Rembrandt appears to
me in his biblical subjects as a true saint who saw God present everywhere,
at every step, in the chamber and in the fields, and did not need the surrounding
pomp of temples and sacrifices to feel drawn towards Him,&rdquo;&mdash;an observation
made at a time when the academic and erudite writer on art was still for
years to perceive in the biblical pictures of the great Dutchman only a crude
conception of form. In another passage, upon the frescoes of Mantegna, in
the Church of the Anchorite, at Padua, there occur the following sentences,
showing the deepest historical perception: &ldquo;How sharp and sure a modernity
stands out in these pictures! From this modernity, which is quite real, and
not merely seeming, with factitious effects, speaking only to the imaginative
faculty, but solid, detailed, and conscientiously circumscribed, and which
at the same time has something austere and industrious and painstaking&mdash;from
this issued subsequent painters such as Titian; and now the liveliness
of their genius, the energy of their nature, enlightened by the spirit of their
predecessors, built up through their strength, was able to soar ever higher
and higher, to rise from earth and create divine but real figures.&rdquo; But, alas!
later on he did not draw the conclusion which followed quite logically from

these observations for the judgment of contemporary German art. He came
back from Italy as a disciple and follower of Winckelmann&rsquo;s writings on art.
&ldquo;Art has once for all, like the works of Homer, been written in Greek, and
he deceives himself who believes that it is German.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Something pagan entered into his soul, a breath from the calm of Olympus.
He derided his earlier Gothic inclinations, contemptuous of all that was
opposed to Greek notions of form, mild and indulgent to all that bore at least
the outward semblance of the antique. He preferred a cold ideal manner to
what was natural, and held Greek art the absolutely valid model. From
it should be derived a fixed canon, a table of accepted laws, to be the
standard for the artist of our own days, and of every age. The <i>Prize Essays</i>,
which he published with Heinrich Meyer in the <i>Propyläen</i>, and later in the
<i>Jena Literary Journal</i>, required the treatment of subjects exclusively from
the Hellenic legendary cycles, &ldquo;whereby the artist should become accustomed
to come out from his own age and surroundings&rdquo;; the composition of pictures
was to correspond strictly with the style of the antique frieze.</p>

<p>Amongst his contemporaries voices were not wanting to point out how
fatal this programme was. Notably, Wilhelm Heinse, in 1776, wrote this
golden sentence: &ldquo;Art can only direct itself to the people with whom it lives.
Every one works for the people amongst whom fate has thrown him, and seeks
to plumb its heart. Every country has its own distinctive art, just as it has
its own climate, its scenery, its own taste, and its own drink.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Similarly, Klopstock opposed Winckelmann&rsquo;s theories in these lines&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg f90" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">

<p>Again, in the <i>German Republic of Letters</i>, in the chapter &ldquo;On High
Treason&rdquo;: &ldquo;It is high treason for any one to maintain that the Greeks cannot
be surpassed.&rdquo; In a letter to Goethe, in the year 1800, Schiller wrote:
&ldquo;The antique was a manifestation of its age which can never return, and to
force the individual production of an individual age after the pattern of one
quite heterogeneous, is to kill that art which can only have a dynamic origin
and effect.&rdquo; Madame de Staël, in her book on <i>Germany</i>, says: &ldquo;If nowadays
the fine arts should be confined to the simplicity of the ancients, we should
not then be able to attain to the original strength which distinguished them,
while we should lose that intimate, composite feeling for life which is especially
found in us. Simplicity in art would easily turn with the moderns into coldness
and affectation, whereas with the ancients it was full of life.&rdquo; In 1797
Counsellor Hirth published in Schiller&rsquo;s <i>Horæ</i> his well-known treatise on
<i>Beauty in Art</i>, which, in opposition to the inanimate type of beauty of
Winckelmann, upheld the characteristic as the first principle in art. Most
remarkable, however, is the breadth of historical outlook which was peculiar
to Herder, and the stern actuality with which in his <i>Plastik</i>, and in the <i>Vierten</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>83</span>
<i>Kritischen Wäldchen</i>, he turned against &ldquo;those pitiful critics, those wretched
and narrow rules of art, that bitter-sweet prattle of universal beauty, through
which the younger generation is being ruined, which is nauseating to the
master, and which, nevertheless, the rabble of connoisseurs takes in its mouth
as words of wisdom.... Shadows and sunrise, lightning and thunder, the
brook and the flame the sculptor cannot model; but is that therefore to
be a reason why it should not be done by the painter? What other law has
painting, what other power and function, than to depict the great scheme
of nature with all her manifestations, in their great and beautiful aspect?
And with what magic it does this! They are not clever who despise landscape
painting, the fragments of nature of the great harmony of creation,
who depreciate it or entirely forbid it to the sincere artist. Is a painter not
to be a painter? Is he to turn statues with his brush, and fiddle with his
colours, just as it may please their antique taste? To represent the scheme
of creation seems vulgar to them; just as though heaven and earth were
not better than an old statue.... Doubtless Greek sculpture stands in the
sea of time like a lighthouse, but it should be only a friend and not a commander.
Painting is a scheme of magic, as vast as the world and as history,
and certainly not every figure in it can or ought to be a statue. In a picture
no single figure is everything; and if they are all equally beautiful, no one
then is beautiful any longer. They become a dull monotony of long-limbed
Greek figures with straight noses, who all stand there and parade and take as
little part in the action as possible. Now, when this misrepresentation of
beauty cries scorn at the same time upon the whole conception, upon history,
upon character, upon action, and this openly attacks that as a lie, there comes
a discord, something insupportable, into painting, which certainly the antique
pedant is unaware of, but which is felt all the more by the true friend of the
antique. And finally, our own actual age, the most fruitful subjects of history,
the liveliest characters, all feeling of a simple truth and precision, will be
<i>antiquarianised</i> away. Posterity will stand and gape at such fantasies in
practice and theory, and will not know what we were, in what age we lived,
nor what brought us to this wretched folly, to the wish to live in another age,
in another nation and climate, and thereby to abandon, or vitiate deplorably,
the whole order of nature and history.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These sentences, however, stood in isolation, or else they came too late.
Immediately after it had been heralded by the literary movement, after the
archæologists had verbally announced its aim, formulated its principles and
laws, German art turned into the new paths. &ldquo;It happened for the first
time in the history of art,&rdquo; wrote Goethe, &ldquo;that important talents took
pleasure in disciplining themselves by the past, and so founding a new epoch
in art.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="noind">was sung in the academies. And this violent grasping after the ideal of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>84</span>
foreign race brought a bitter
revenge, since not one of the
artists who now appeared had the
genius to create anything new out
of the old.</p>

<p>The disciples of Winckelmann
had not been, like Goethe and
Schiller, vigorous naturalists until
the spirit of ancient times had
looked upon them, and they were
consequently still less able to resist
her glance. They entered upon the
new road not with that generative
impulse of the creative mind, whose
superabundance did not know what
course it should take, what stream
it should find. They adopted the
forms, as they had been provided by
the greater ages, without any doubt
as to their absolute excellence,
or the least attempt at any happy
innovation. And if they &ldquo;have
better understood&rdquo; the Greeks
than their predecessors in Italy and France were able to do, then one is
never less like an original nature than when one imitates them faithfully.
Winckelmann&rsquo;s road to inimitability led not only to a more hollow
and lifeless Classicism than there ever had been, to a more cheerless and unpleasant
art than any which the school of Bologna had produced. It tended,
above all, since the thinking people had thought out the classic idea&mdash;which
the other nations had not&mdash;to the sacrifice of all pictorial technique, of the
whole knowledge which the age had up till then possessed. There is a legend
in the history of the Church, that at the time of the donation of Constantine
a voice was heard from Heaven: &ldquo;This day has poison entered into the body
of the Church.&rdquo; To the German art of our century this poison was the
writings of Winckelmann.</p>

<p>First of all it was <i>Anton Rafael Mengs</i>, whose originally strong and great
talent was distorted by the counsels of the learned. As in the works of the
Caracci, those only are to-day of any interest which reveal themselves least
as eclectics and most as children of the seventeenth century, so with Mengs&mdash;he
is only enjoyable now where he did not try to be antique, but sympathised
without too much reflection on the traditions of his age. He is particularly so
in his fine pastel portraits in the Dresden Gallery, which are wholly influenced
by the taste for <i>rococo</i>, and are its last expiring manifestation. They are a
testimony that it was not without some justice that the Apelles of Dresden
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>85</span>
was called by his contemporaries the most remarkable German painter of
the eighteenth century. Rosalba Carriera and Liotard seem weak and insipid
beside him; Reynolds only at his best had that characteristic clearness, that
plastic energy of modelling, and that life-like colouring. There is nothing
insipid or affected, nothing of that simpering affability that his successors
brought into vogue. And when we remember that they proceeded from a
youth of sixteen, the strength and simplicity of intuition seem incredible.
In his later portraits, too, painted in oil, the better ones are directly classic;
very noble in their clear, subtile, grey tone, strikingly alive, and, withal, of
an extraordinary independence which shows no leaning upon any other
master whatever. Mengs belongs to those portrait painters who look into the
souls of their sitters, and he ranks, in works like his portrait of himself, in the
Munich Gallery, amongst the best portrait painters of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>In his huge ecclesiastical paintings he is the son of that period which had
just commenced to be touched by the pallor of thought, and groped eclectically
now in this direction and now in that. &ldquo;First of all must the weeds be rooted
up,&rdquo; wrote Zanotti in his <i>Directions to a Young Man upon Painting</i>. &ldquo;And then
we must go back again to Cimabue and Giotto, and again, a few years later,
to Buonarotti and Sanzio, and their noble successors whose footsteps are no
longer sought or followed by any one. But when such a happy resurrection
will take place, God knows!&rdquo; The old Ismael Mengs believed that that was
his concern; he chose Antonio da Allegri and Rafael Sanzio as sponsors for
his son. Anton Rafael should become the eclectic reformer of art, and as
he was probably the first painter who, by the express permission of the Elector
of Saxony, was allowed to visit the hitherto inaccessible Dresden Gallery,
this wish was easy of accomplishment.</p>

<p>He was quick in freeing himself from the immediate tradition of the
age, and in harmony with the teaching of the Caracci, in returning to the so-called
&ldquo;higher&rdquo; models of painting. When one runs across such of his
pictures in some gallery&mdash;notably his altar
pieces&mdash;they strike one as the works of
some good master of the seventeenth century
whose name one cannot, for the moment,
recollect. His famous &ldquo;Holy Night,&rdquo; in
which he wished to enter into rivalry with
Correggio, has something of a Maratti about
it, only the heads are more vacant and insipid.</p>

<p>It is that unfortunate &ldquo;Parnassus&rdquo; in
the Villa Albani which first marks the collapse
of this great talent. When, upon the advice
of his friend Winckelmann, he turned from
the study of Raphael and Correggio to that
of the antique, Mengs forfeited not only the
remnant of all that was essentially natural,
but even all the picturesque qualities which
had hitherto distinguished him. After painting
had so long taken sculpture in tow, now sculpture seemed anxious to be
revenged on it, and there was a manifestation of those prettily painted figures
in plaster which for some score years afterwards paraded in every German
picture.</p>

<p>For Winckelmann&rsquo;s mistake, as Herder had already pointed out with
great justice, consisted not only in this, that he set up for imitation a departed
ideal for the consciousness of his contemporaries, but notably in that he
obtruded principles upon modern painting which might be valid in ancient
sculpture. Since the antique ideal was solely a plastic one, and neither the
Greek Prussian nor, later, Meister Ephraim was clear as to the difference
between sculpture and painting, they practically recommended the painter
to work after plastic models.</p>

<p>The fact that Lessing, in discussing the limits of painting in his <i>Laocoön</i>,
took a work of sculpture as his starting-point, proves that to him the laws
and conditions of both arts were valued as the same. They denounced the
confusion of the art of painting with poetry, and instead advocated the confounding
of painting with sculpture, which was no less hazardous.</p>

<td class="tcr f90 pb2">PORTRAIT OF A LADY AS A VESTAL.</td></tr></table>

<p>In this manner there came an alien element into Mengs&rsquo; hitherto quite
pictorial apprehension; a vain and exclusively reproductive ideality deprived
his figures of the last remnant of truth to nature which he had formerly understood
how to give them. It is difficult to believe that Winckelmann&rsquo;s paroxysm
of friendship should have burst out, upon the completion of the &ldquo;Parnassus,&rdquo;
into this pæan: &ldquo;During the whole of the new age a more beautiful work
has not appeared in painting; even Raphael would have bowed his head.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>87</span>
The whole is nothing more than a <i>mélange</i> of plagiarism and <i>banal</i> reminiscences,
without soul or perception, without freshness or individuality; a mere
plastic warehouse, and not even a painted antique group, but a daubed compilation
of solitary statues, colder and more lifeless than any Baltoni ever
painted. There was an audacious, strong aim, genial strength and an
overwhelming flow of fantasy in the contemporary works of the great <i>décorateur</i>
Tiepolo; here there is a mere work of intellect which with philological
aid builds up the composition entirely of borrowed materials. The only
thing which even still points in this work to the good old times is a more
solid study of form and colour than all that which originated in Germany
during the next fifty years. The figures are painted with a strength and
bloom which are still quite worthy of the <i>rococo</i>.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;good <i>Angelica</i>&rdquo; is the second representative of this phase of transition.
She, too, at the persuasion of her friend Winckelmann, clothed herself as
an ancient Vestal, but her true woman&rsquo;s nature left in her classical raiment
still a neat fashion of <i>rococo</i>. Through her intercourse with Winckelmann
she became somewhat of a &ldquo;blue-stocking,&rdquo; and studied the historians of antiquity
in order to find there subjects like Cornelia, the mother of the Gracchi,
Agrippina with the urn of Germanicus, Phryne, and the like. Still more
there were the tender legends of the ancients, out of whose store she satisfied
her patrons: Adonis at the chase, Psyche, Ariadne abandoned by Theseus
or found by Bacchus, the death of Alcestis, Hero and Leander. In these she
is soft to the point of sentimentality, and pleasant to the point of nausea.
Goethe says of her with justice: &ldquo;The forms and traits of the figures have
little variety, the expression of the passions no force, the heroes look like
gentle boys, or girls in disguise.&rdquo; But he also says of her: &ldquo;The lightness,
grace in form, colour, conception, and treatment is the one ruling quality
of the numerous works of our fair artist. No living painter has surpassed
her either in grace of representation or in the taste and capacity with which
she handles her brush.&rdquo; And this decision, too, can still be endorsed. Angelica
knew how to impart to those clear lines and forms demanded by Winckelmann
a grace now coquettish, now sentimental, but always extremely lovable.
She has struck soft and&mdash;notably in her portraits of women&mdash;very tender
colour chords.</p>

<p>She and Mengs were the last who still possessed considerable technical
knowledge. Almost everything which has survived of the tradition of craftsmanship
in Germany in the nineteenth century is traceable to Mengs&rsquo; influence,
and that fact so offended his successors that they no longer counted
him as one of them, but put him contemptuously aside as a &ldquo;mannerist
painter by recipe.&rdquo; &ldquo;Such technical knowledge,&rdquo; wrote Goethe, &ldquo;hinders
that complete abstraction and elevation over the real, which is asked of
identical representations in sculpture, which merely furnish forms in their
highest purity and beauty.&rdquo; &ldquo;Colouring, light and shadows, do not give
such value to a painting as noble contour alone,&rdquo; wrote Winckelmann,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>88</span>
and these sentences became the
starting-point of the next generation.
Winckelmann&rsquo;s error when
he recommended the imitation of
Greek sculpture to the modern
painter consisted still further in
this, that he confused &ldquo;noble simplicity
and quiet grandeur&rdquo; with
lack of colour and coldness. Herder
had written well: &ldquo;In distinction
to the compact harmony of form in
sculpture, painting has her harmonious
unity in colour and light.
I do not know why many theorists
should have spoken so contemptuously
of what is called <i>chiaroscuro</i>,
the grouping of light and shade;
it is the instrument of genius with
every scholar and master, the eye
with which he sees, the flashing,
spiritual sea with which he sprinkles
everything, and on which, indeed,
every outline also depends. This
divine, spiritual sea of light, this
fairyland of adjusted light and
shade, is the business of painting:
why should we fight against nature,
and not allow every art to do what it alone can do and do best?&rdquo;</p>

<p>His words died away. The philosophic tendency of the century, which
sought to penetrate into the &ldquo;soul&rdquo; of things, and to recreate things from the
throne of the universe of the abstract, tried its hand also upon painting.
By abstracting from the manifestation of colour, and touching upon form
and line, it came to believe that in these plastic elements it had discovered
the Essential of which it was in search.</p>

<p>Once on the road to execute statues in paint, the question ensued, Ought
we to paint our statues? And as that age, following in Winckelmann&rsquo;s track,
understood no word of the significance which the specific, picturesque principles
had for the Greeks, it was only logical that they should endeavour to reconcile
the idea of immaculate whiteness with that of classical beauty, to see pure
beauty in absence of colour, and in consequence to accentuate the question,
Ought we to paint our <i>pictures</i>? To painters the most suspicious element in
a painting became the paint! There is nothing more urgent for them to do
than to deprive themselves ascetically of all coloristic means of expression.
Painting is shown to be an essential form of corruption&mdash;&ldquo;The brush is become
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>89</span>
the ruin of our art,&rdquo; wrote Cornelius&mdash;and there commences the era of a
cartoon style hitherto unprecedented, which is to be carried on by the most
highly endowed in the most earnest fashion. While during the <i>rococo</i> the
sense of colour had reached, through a piquant arrangement of the most
tender and variegated tones, its highest point of refinement, there followed now
as a reaction an absolute lack of colour. The ideal is seen in an abstract beauty
of line, colour as a secondary matter and a vain show. It was of as much value
as a vari-coloured dress, which nature could put on or off, without being less
nature thereby. Amongst painters there was talk of nothing but outlines.
This line style, whose world is not the wall or the canvas, but white paper,
can do with a proportionately meagre study of nature. Why, therefore, when
the ideal was so easy of attainment, drudge in the academy, where, moreover,
since the introduction of Mengs&rsquo; Classicism, universal desolation of the spirit
and doctrinaire pedantry reigned? As Mengs had broken with the taste of
the <i>rococo</i>, so the younger generation broke with its technique, whilst they
left the academy in open dissatisfaction, and threw off in contempt the whole
paraphernalia of technical traditions.</p>

<p><i>Carstens</i> plays the momentous rôle in German art as the first who trod this
path. He has more individuality than Mengs; <i>antiquarianising</i> with him is
not exclusively an external derivation and a cold imitation: he lives in the
antique; the world of the Greek poets is his spiritual home, and their profound
thoughts find in him a subtle interpreter. But he has, at the same time, the
melancholy fame of being the first of the frivolous to renounce the national
inheritance, the knowledge bequeathed by the <i>rococo</i> age, and so definitely
to cut the chain which should otherwise have connected German art of the
nineteenth century with that of the eighteenth.</p>

<p>Through the <i>Investigations of Beauty in Painting</i>, by Daniel Webb, which
was founded on Winckelmann&rsquo;s <i>Thoughts on Imitation</i>, the seed of Hellenism
was already sown in the youth&rsquo;s soul. He heard talk of the dwarf intelligences
of the age; how the studios of inferior artists were full of gaping visitors,
whilst the halls of the Vatican stood deserted. &ldquo;Learn the taste for beauty
in the antique,&rdquo; the cooper&rsquo;s apprentice learns from Webb&rsquo;s works. &ldquo;Let
us meditate upon the style of the painter&rsquo;s art in the &lsquo;Laocoön,&rsquo; with regard
to the fighter. Notice the sublimity in the divine character of Apollo. Let
us stand hushed before the exquisite beauty of the Venus di Medici. These
are the extreme incentives of the art of drawing.... The Belvedere Apollo
and the daughter of Niobe offer us an ideal of nobility and beauty. Raphael&rsquo;s
drawing never reached to such a height of perfection as we find in the statues
of the Greeks.... Whither do you carry me, gods and demigods and heroes
who live in marble? I follow your call, and, Imagination! thy eternal laws.
I go into the Villa Medici and breathe there the purest air. I stretch myself
on a flowery plot, the shadow of the orange trees covers me;&mdash;there, unmolested,
I gaze at a group full of the highest feminine beauty. Niobe, my
beloved, beautiful mother of beautiful children, thou fairest among women,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>90</span>
how I love thee!&rdquo; So dreamed Asmus Jacob in the wine-cellar at Eckernförde,
or in his solitary chamber by the dim light of his lamp, as he had been
seized with giddiness before all the great and marvellous revelations of art
which this book had afforded him. In his enraptured fantasy he painted
the hour nearer and nearer when he should attain to a sight of the works which
were described. Could he have looked into the future, what a picture would
have come before his eyes! Would he have recognised himself in the broken-down
man, with the pale countenance, the grief-marked expression, and the
decrepit figure, who in Rome gazed spellbound at the Colossus of Monte Cavallo?</p>

<p>Our Holsteiner was two-and-twenty years old when he discarded the
cooper&rsquo;s apron and entered the Copenhagen Academy, being then too old for
any regular training. His head was so full of &ldquo;inventions&rdquo; that &ldquo;it could
not enter his mind to begin from the beginning.&rdquo; &ldquo;Drawing from the life
did not satisfy me; the fellow, too, who sat as my model, although he was for
the rest well built, seemed to me, in contrast with the antique from which I
had attained a higher ideal of beauty, so petty and imperfect that I thought I
could easily learn to draw a better figure if I only confined myself to that. I
resolved not to visit the academy, in spite of the other artists impressing upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>91</span>
me the importance and utility of academic study.&rdquo; He stayed daily, instead,
for hours together before the casts in the antique room, and &ldquo;a holy feeling
of adoration, almost compelling me to tears, pervaded me. There I never
drew at all after an antique. When I attempted it, it was as though all my
emotion was chilled by it. I thought that I should learn more if I gazed at
them with great studiousness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus he reached, as Fernow says, the method whereby he &ldquo;did not tread
the ordinary way of imitation, gradually progressing to a special invention,
but began at once with invention.&rdquo; There he was the true child of his age.
At a period whose creative power found its highest expression in philosophy
and poetry, the painter strove for the reputation only of being the <i>poet</i> of his
pictures. And Carstens encountered the old tragedians and philosophic
writers with a fine, poetic understanding. &ldquo;The Greek Heroes with Cheiron,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Helen at the Skæan Gate,&rdquo; &ldquo;Ajax,&rdquo; &ldquo;Ph&oelig;nix and Odysseus in the Tent of
Achilles,&rdquo; &ldquo;Priam and Achilles,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Fates,&rdquo; &ldquo;Night with her Children,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Sleep and Death,&rdquo; &ldquo;The passage of Megapenthes,&rdquo; &ldquo;Homer before the
People,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Golden Age&rdquo;&mdash;all these prints have really something of the
noble simplicity and quiet harmony of Greek art.</p>

<p>It can be understood, then, that such subjects should be in the highest
degree interesting to an archæologist. When Carstens, in April 1795, was
organising the famous exhibition of his collected works in Rome, Fernow
published in Wieland&rsquo;s <i>Deutscher Merkur</i> a discourse in which he celebrated
him as the creator of a new epoch. From the very first, however, an equally
resolute opposition was excited in artistic circles. The painter Müller, nicknamed
&ldquo;The Devil&rsquo;s Miller,&rdquo; who at that time wandered about Rome as a
cicerone, proves that Winckelmann&rsquo;s principles, even at the threshold of the
century, by no means met with universal acceptance. The <i>Writing of Herr
Müller, Painter in Rome, upon the Exhibition of Herr Professor Carstens</i>, with
the motto <i>Amicus Plato, Amicus Socrates, magis amica veritas</i>, was published
in 1797 in Schiller&rsquo;s <i>Horæ</i>. Carstens imitated; he worked rather by reminiscence
and understanding than by fantasy. Isolated figures do not bring
their individuality to an expression. Then he pointed out the models, discussed
the lack of colour, and proved numerous sins of the draughtsman
against nature in detail. The artist must ever seek to find characteristic
expression; composition comes in the second degree. Technique, even if the
previous age has been an epoch of fabrication, must always stand in the foreground;
it is not only from the artist, but from the connoisseur, that knowledge
is demanded, and in consequence of this exhibition Carstens is recommended
to forbear from his fantastical geniality, observe nature, and achieve a picture
exactly, since it is only from nature that the ideal springs, and consequently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>93</span>
nothing can be great and beautiful in the representation which is not right and
true. In almost similar words, later on, Koch, in his <i>Thoughts on Painting</i>,
and with him the majority of artists, has censured Carstens. And posterity
cannot but allow them to be in the right as against the archæologists.</p>

<p>Admirable in Carstens is the zeal with which he defended his ideal, the
sacred fire which burned within him and sustained him, even during those
years when his sickly frame was weakened by consumption. Art was,
as he wrote, his element, his religion, his beatitude, his existence. And
it is already something great to wear oneself out alone for the sake of an ideal.
Carstens was a sublime dreamer. It will not be forgotten of him that, in an
age when abundant mediocrity and manufacture were all-prevailing, he once
more pointed, unfaltering in his noble and pure intention, to the sublimity of
artistic creation. The history of art, however, has not to deal with hearts,
but to judge logically by results; and it would not be doing justice to the old
masters, nor to those earnest <i>rococo</i> painters who sat at their easels with less
noble intentions, but with so much greater knowledge of their craft, if one
were to proclaim Carstens, in consideration of the self-sacrifice and renunciation
which he showed in the fight for his ideal, as a martyr and a genius, a
pioneer of German art. He was not a genius, as he thought himself, and
announced so proudly to Heinitz, the Minister; for that he possessed too
little originality. It is not imagination, but reminiscence, which created his
works. The outlines of his plates are done with fine sentiment, but sentiment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>94</span>
taken from the Greeks, and he required no genius to recognise in his recollection
and his hand a transcript of Greek forms. What pleases us in Carstens is in
substance not Carstens, but an echo of what we like in the Greek statues and
vases, in Michael Angelo and other old masters.</p>

<p>He was not a martyr, because in his struggles he met with assistance and
encouragement such as were granted to no old master, and if, in spite of that,
he never rose above the cares of life, that is only a proof of the limitations and
partiality of his art. He had lost all decorative facility; still more was the
inheritance of oil painting first naturally mislaid by him, and by draughtsmanship
alone not even Dürer nor Rembrandt could have lived.</p>

<p>This deficiency in technique must even debar him from claiming any
higher signification than that of a clever dilettante. He is not an artist who
does not in the midst of his exaltation think to put himself in possession of the
means which can turn the lispings of genius into a fully intelligible language.
Carstens&rsquo; plates seduce by a certain wavy treatment of the lines, but no one
of them can sustain critical appreciation. It is inconsistent to work in the
beautiful and not to become free of ugliness, to move in the great, in the sublime,
and at the same time to fall from one defect of form to another, from
coarse uncouthness into the most elementary sins against drawing and proportion.
Carstens was a draughtsman who could not draw, and, with this
limitation of his genius, by no manner of means a founder of German art.
One cannot call him a mannerist, because with him art and individuality
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>95</span>
corresponded; but, nevertheless, like Mengs and Lairesse, he gave art at
second-hand, and only differs from them in that with him commences that
complete abandonment of the idea of colour which after him disfigured German
art. For the future it was quite indifferent that Thorwaldsen took suggestions
from Carstens, and Genelli trod in his footprints as a draughtsman.</p>

<p><i>Bonaventura Genelli</i>, if one takes for once the standpoint of the painters
of his time, who desired to be the &ldquo;poets&rdquo; of their works, is certainly a not
unremarkable poet. In him, who was born in the year of Carstens&rsquo; death,
the spirit of the little Holsteiner was raised to life, and the figure which he
assumed in this new incarnation actually made an impression like a picture
out of beauty-illuminated days of Hellas. The muscular, thick-set figure of a
youthful Hercules, with a broad chest and sturdy neck, a head of short brown
curly hair, full lips fringed by the compact beard of a Sophocles, the short
Greek nose, grave eyes glancing out from beneath the strong brows&mdash;such
was Genelli, a Hellene left stranded in Germany, the last Centaur, as Heyse
has depicted him in his novel&mdash;&ldquo;an antediluvian, mythological enigma on
four sound legs sprung upon our godless world.&rdquo; Thus he sat, as he
himself writes, in Rome, &ldquo;in his dirty chamber, bare except for a chair
or two, rickety or quite broken down, and on the wall a pair of hawks
nailed up, whose pinions served as models for his winged figures.&rdquo; Thus
he sat later in his little house in the <i>Sendlingergasse</i> at Munich, and lived in
his world of imagination. Perhaps, had he been the child of a more fortunate
period in art, he might have become a strong and memorable painter; as a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>96</span>
successor of Carstens he has left behind him a legacy of two suites of copper
prints&mdash;the two tragedies of the &ldquo;Profligate&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Witch.&rdquo; He existed,
moreover, only in contour; he never rose above harmoniously outlined
silhouette. It was only to this point that his talent would sustain him. The
more he wished to produce shadow, water-colour, or even oil, the more tedious
and pale and vague did he become. And even in his drawing he shares with
Carstens the desolate generalisation of form, the eternal euphony which so
soon becomes wearisome and monotonous. To beauty of line everything is
offered up. The blank characterlessness of the faces is even more noticeable
with him than with Carstens, who had, after all, in his youth drawn excellent
portraits in crayons, and on this account was able to give even to his Greeks
more individual traits and a certain variety of expression. With Genelli
the heads are treated as no more than parts of the body, and as they gave no
opportunity for flowing lines, they have not even the same graciousness as
the limbs. His women fared worst, for whilst he could be his own model for
his men, he created the <i>ewig Weibliche</i> out of his inner consciousness. In men
and women the eyes, in particular, are merely animal.</p>

<p>Carstens&rsquo; influence on German art has been then entirely a negative one.
It was not on such a foundation that a German art could arise. He prepared
no ground for his successors on which they could build further; but through
his abandonment of the whole capital which, since Stephen Lochner, had been
handed down at compound interest from one generation of painters to another,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>97</span>
he rather cut away the ground from under their feet. &ldquo;For very easily
can art go astray, but it is a difficult and lengthy process for her to recover
herself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The art which was born in that humble studio in Rome to the sickly,
neurotic man, the &ldquo;famous draughtsman,&rdquo; needed later, in order to become
technically healthy again, an impulse replete with life from abroad.</p>

<p class="center chap">CHAPTER IV</p>

<p class="center chap2">THE CLASSICAL REACTION IN FRANCE</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">In</span> France also modern art began with a stream of antiquarianism
which flowed from the same archæological source. De Brosses
published a history of the Roman Republic, and wrote on Herculaneum.
Leroy produced his <i>Ruines des plus anciens monuments de la
Grèce</i> in 1758. Shortly afterwards the <i>Recueils d&rsquo;Antiquité</i> of Caylus and
Hamilton were published. The former undertook his great journeys, and
presented the Academy of Inscriptions with a succession of archæological
treatises. He is perhaps the first since Batteux and Coypel who again
makes of the modern painter a positive demand for a quiet beauty of lines
after the &ldquo;<i>manière simple et noble du bel antique</i>.&rdquo; The architects begin to
take counsel of Vitruvius, and to work after some model borrowed from the
antique. Soufflot rebuilt the Pantheon, and produced the Temple of Pæstum.</p>

<p>Even in 1763 Grimm could write: &ldquo;For some years past we have been
making keen inquiry for antique ornaments and forms. The predilection for
them has become so universal that now everything is to be done <i>à la Grecque</i>.
The interior and exterior decorations of houses, furniture, dress material, and
goldsmiths&rsquo; work all bear alike the stamp of the Greeks. The fashion passes
from architecture to millinery: our ladies have their hair dressed <i>à la Grecque</i>,
our fine gentlemen would think themselves dishonoured if they did not hold
in their hands <i>une boîte à la Grecque</i>.&rdquo; Even Diderot&rsquo;s preference for the
ethical and emotional, as Greuze had painted it&mdash;and as Diderot himself
had dramatised it&mdash;veered round at the commencement of the sixties into
an enthusiasm for the antique. After 1761 he carried on in the salons a war
of extermination against poor old Boucher, and lectured him in a menacing
voice upon the &ldquo;great and severe taste of antiquity.&rdquo; He twitted him with
possessing neither reality nor taste, and produced in proof the fact that, in
the whole catalogue of Boucher&rsquo;s figures, not four could be found which could
be employed in relief, or even as statues. The new taste demanded pure and
simple lines, the beauty of sculpture; it went back to the antique. When a
French translation of Winckelmann appeared in 1765 he spoke out, on the
occasion of a review of the book, clearly and plainly: &ldquo;<i>Il me semble qu&rsquo;il
faudrait étudier l&rsquo;antique pour apprendre à voir la nature</i>.&rdquo; In the same vein
Watelet pronounced on Boucher: &ldquo;<i>Jamais artiste n&rsquo;a plus ouvertement témoigné
son mépris pour la vraie beauté telle qu&rsquo;elle a été sentie et exprimée par les statuaires</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>99</span>
<i>de l&rsquo;ancienne Grèce</i>.&rdquo; Thus the change in the artistic outlook was heralded
long before the curtain went up upon the events of 1789.</p>

<p><i>Madame Vigée-Lebrun</i>, the French Angelica Kauffmann, possessed of a
tender, soft, sympathetic talent, is perhaps the truest representative of this
gracious, entirely French transition style, over which like a breath, but only like
a breath, hovers the antique. She has in her portraits, in an especially refined
manner, fixed that age when noble ladies desired to forget the Marquise and
Duchess, to exhibit only the wife and mother, and believed that by unconstraint
of attitude in their simple white robe, the scarf thrown modestly over the
shoulders, they had effected a return to antique simplicity. Boucher, moved to
the depths of his consciousness by Diderot, resolved to paint a picture taken
from ancient history. Greuze painted &ldquo;Severus and Caracalla,&rdquo; Fragonard
&ldquo;Ch&oelig;reas and Callirhöe.&rdquo; Hubert Robert grew more and more archæological,
and played in his landscapes with ancient remains and classical ruins. Vien
became enthusiastic over antique gems, and thought he must draw the conclusion,
from the noble calm of these figures, that the amiable coquetry and capricious
garments of <i>rococo</i> were without nobility. His plan was &ldquo;to study the antique&mdash;Raphael,
the Caracci, Domenichino, Michael Angelo, and, in one word, all
those masters whose works convey the character of truth and grandeur.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But what gave far other significance to the French classicism of the ensuing
period was that great event in the world&rsquo;s history, of which France became
the theatre at the close of the eighteenth century. In the secluded gardens
of Versailles, where the goat-footed Pan embraced the tall, white nymphs by
an artificial water-fall, the noble lords and ladies, clad as Pierrots and Columbines,
overheard in the midst of their whispered flirtations the menacing
earthquake which was announced in thunder from Paris. Soon they beheld
the earth crack and burst asunder, as that time came when the air was filled
with the smoke of powder, when the first notes of the Marseillaise rang
out, and in the Place de la Concorde, where to-day the loveliest fountains
in the world are playing, blood ran from a dozen guillotines. That &ldquo;<i>après
nous le deluge</i>&rdquo; of the Marquise de Pompadour had become a dire, prophetic
truth, and in that flood of blood and horrors the artistic ideal of the eighteenth
century was also washed away. The Revolution gave the death-blow to
<i>rococo</i>. At one stroke it overthrew the most pleasant of all French
periods, the truest presentiment of French grace and <i>esprit</i>, the noble
and amiable art of Louis <span class="sc">XV</span>, which the melancholy, life-emitting Watteau,
Boucher, and Fragonard cause to hover before us as in the clouds of a dream.
Classicism, however, attained through it a new and stronger basis, a certain
connection with modern life, since it was transposed by it from the Museum
of Antiquity into the middle of the Place de la Concorde beneath the guillotine.</p>

<p>What the age of the Revolution demanded of art was at all events not a
&ldquo;noble style,&rdquo; as Vien had required of it, but rather in the first place a Spartan
virtue. Various philosophical writers had drawn a parallel between the
organisation of the old and the modern state; they had exerted themselves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>100</span>
to show that the old Republics were models of an almost absolute perfection,
which the modern should, in so far as it was possible, imitate. They had contrasted
the moral conditions of Sparta and the Roman Republic with the moral
constitution of contemporary, monarchical France. They had quoted on
every opportunity the acts of virtue, renunciation, courage, and patriotic
sacrifice of the great men of antiquity; they had used these deeds as a means
of proving their thesis, and their ideas aroused deep echoes in men&rsquo;s hearts.</p>

<td class="tcr f90 pb2">PORTRAIT OF THE PAINTER WITH HER DAUGHTER.</td></tr></table>

<p>The sentiment of Rome had entered into the people as a thing of flesh and
blood even before the catastrophe had ensued. &ldquo;We were more prepared,&rdquo;
wrote Nodier, &ldquo;for the particular tone of the language of the Revolution
than people would have believed, and it cost us little pains to pass from the
studies of our <i>gymnases</i> to the strife of the forum. In the schools we had prize
compositions set of this kind: Who stands higher, the elder Brutus who
judged his children, or the younger Brutus who judged his father? And so
Livy and Tacitus have done more to overthrow the monarchical system than
Voltaire and Rousseau.&rdquo; It was evident then that France, so soon as she had
freed herself from her kings, so soon as she had spoken the word &ldquo;Republic,&rdquo;
must take the <i>Roman</i> Republic as her pattern. People lived in an atmosphere
of antiquity; the great citizens of Rome and Athens were ranged with the
French National Convention; Scævola, Scipio, Cato, Cincinnatus, were
the idols of the populace. The speakers in the council cited the ancients in
preference; Madame Vigée-Lebrun gave <i>soupers à la Grecque</i>. &ldquo;Everything
was ordered according to the <i>Voyage d&rsquo;Anacharsis</i>&mdash;garments, viands, amusements,
and the table, all were Athenian. Madame Lebrun herself was Aspasia;
M. l&rsquo;Abbé Barthélémy, in a Greek dress with a laurel wreath on his head,
recited a poem; M. de Cabierès played the golden lyre as Memnon, and young
boys waited at table as slaves. The table itself was set entirely with Greek
utensils, and all the viands were actually those of ancient Greece.&rdquo; Children
were given Greek and Roman names. People called themselves &ldquo;Romans.&rdquo;
&ldquo;<i>Mais, je l&rsquo;aimais, Romains!</i>&rdquo; cried Coulon at the death of Mirabeau. Paris is
Rome. In the theatre the bust of Brutus is set opposite that of Voltaire, and the
actor says: &ldquo;<i>O buste réveré de Brutus, d&rsquo;un grand homme, transporté dans Paris
tu n&rsquo;as point quitté Rome</i>.&rdquo; And as with the bust of Brutus in the theatre, that
of Mucius Scævola appears in the cafés, which Parisian journalists, still full
of remembrances of ancient history studied in the gymnasium, liken to the
Lyceum and the Porch. In every case ancient Rome is set up as the
exemplar. The Parisian collection of engravings on copper possesses a reproduction
of the guillotine, with the inscription: <i>A similar machine was used
for the execution of the Roman, Titus Manlius</i>. A valet committed suicide,
and quoted the illustrious example of Seneca. Had it been possible, people
would have gladly thrown themselves back eighteen hundred years into the
past, with all its grandeur, its simplicity, and its ruthlessness. Political and
social forms did not suffice; even the implements and costume of the ancients
were again brought into honour. Furniture put on antiquarian shapes; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>101</span>
walls were decorated <i>à la Grecque</i>. The lively frivolity of <i>rococo</i>, with its
freaks and fancies, was no longer adapted to the boudoir of the age of
revolution, now transformed into the political council-room. Twists and
curves were no longer permitted: everything had to be straightforward,
logical, ungenerous, inexorable. Men went clad wretchedly, with red
Phrygian caps and no breeches. Women and girls cast aside their ordinary
attire and put on straight, falling drapery, discarded their heeled shoes and
bound sandals round their feet, shook the powder from their locks and tied
their hair in a Greek knot. &ldquo;Dressed in white raiment without adornment,
but decked in the virtue of simplicity,&rdquo; they appeared in the cabinet of the
president, in order to surrender their jewels for the salvation of their country,
like those Roman matrons in the time of Camillus.</p>

<p>And, in co-operation with the building up of this new world, painting
also advanced. It was only when it assisted to arouse civic virtue, it was
said at a sitting of the jury at the Salon of 1793, that painting could possess
a right to exist in the new state, and as the handmaid of this patriotism might
fulfil an even higher mission than it had done in ancient Greece and Rome.
&ldquo;The Greeks and Romans were indeed only slaves, but we French are by
nature free, philosophers in character, virtuous in our every perception, and
artists through our taste.&rdquo; In proportion as the French Republic transcended
the old free states, so too must French art take the lead of the antique. &ldquo;All
that stimulated art in Greece, the gymnastic exercises, the public games, the
national festivals, is also accessible to the French, who possess above all that
which the Greeks lacked, the feeling for true liberty. To depict the history
of a free people is indeed quite another mission for the true genius than to
embody scenes out of mythology.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Through this fresh <i>nuance</i>, which classicism thus acquired, the ground
was cut from under the feet of those who devoted themselves to the study of
the antique as conceived by Diderot. The new moral age would have no
traffic with those artists in whom the last smile of the eighteenth century
was personified. Their pictures, full of grace and caprice, fell into the same
disrepute into which everything of yesterday had come, and it was only with
a bitter smile that they followed the course of events. The younger Moreau,
that animated master of <i>rococo</i>, became academically cold and tedious when
he designed his book on the French costume of the Revolution. The good
Fragonard, who was only fifty-nine in 1789, and lived till 1806, saw himself
hooted in spite of his &ldquo;Ch&oelig;reas.&rdquo; He, the true representative of frivolous
tenderness, of fair and roseate hues, had lost every right to exist in the new
world, and ended his life by a sad death when, after the Reign of Terror, there
was no longer a place for <i>fêtes galantes</i>. A delightful portrait of himself, which
he painted in the first period of the Revolution, shows us an old man, clothed
entirely in black, softly melancholy, standing in a formal, dusky-brown salon.
On the table on which his arm rests lies a guitar, at his feet a portfolio of
engravings; but he neither plays the guitar nor looks at the prints. In the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>102</span>
shadows of the falling evening he reminds himself forlornly of past days, and
his bald forehead, where so many rose-coloured dreams have passed, is overcast
with gloomy shadows.</p>

<p>Greuze, too, outlived himself. It was no use for him to pretend more
and more to the utmost virtue, and to paint an &ldquo;Ariadne at Naxos.&rdquo; He
died in misery and oblivion in 1805. The demands which this new classicism
made were able to be satisfied by no one any longer, not even by Vien. However
loudly he might proclaim himself a student of the Greeks, he, nevertheless,
remained a very timid and lukewarm revolutionary. An old man, cold and
peaceful and stolid, moderate in everything, he had neither the energy nor the
audacity of the reformer. He had been the Court painter of Louis <span class="sc">XVI</span>, a
most monarchically disposed and loyal man, and was a suspect on this ground
alone to those who were in power in 1789. His pictures, too, describe no more
than the end of a world. Greuze, Fragonard, and Vien, in spite of their assumed
seriousness, survived only as gallant phantoms in the new age, by the side of
those men of more rugged countenance who inaugurated the nineteenth century.</p>

<tr><td class="captionx">JACQUES LOUIS DAVID.&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<i>L&rsquo;Art.</i></td></tr></table>

<p><i>Jacques Louis David</i> first satisfied the new requirements, and in so doing
lent to French classicism, if only for a few years, a certain touch of far greater
vivacity. He it was who carried through, in all its consequence, that
reformation in taste which Vien had sought in externals, in costume,
furniture and decoration; who inspired the gems painted by Vien with
republican pathos, and became in this way the great herald of that
age which read Plutarch and made Paris into a modern Sparta.
David, <i>Prix de Rome</i> after three successive failures, still came from
that &ldquo;corrupt epoch&rdquo; against which
Republican prudery was so excited.
At the age of twenty-six he had
already painted Soffits, in the manner
of his kinsman &ldquo;Boucher, to say it
with respect.&rdquo; But the journey to
Rome converted Saul into Paul. In
1775 Vien, on his appointment as
director of the Roman Academy, had
taken him to Italy as his best pupil,
and hardly dreamt at that time that
this young man would strike out on such
an entirely new path from his Roman
studies. He did not wait for the
Revolution to be converted; when the
hour struck he was ready. Thus his
first pictures were in a manner the
prelude to the Revolution. In them
he had already quite consciously
entered upon the road along which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>103</span>
he was to go later. His &ldquo;Oath of the Horatii&rdquo; and his &ldquo;Brutus,&rdquo;
both painted in Rome in 1784, proclaimed his programme. The little, rosy
loves, the doves of Venus, and all the charming frivolity and gallantry of <i>rococo</i>,
received their final dismissal, and rough men walked in their stead. He
broke his staff over all that he had previously venerated, and declared loudly
that he had sinned when in his youth he had believed in the flowery palette
of <i>rococo</i>, and completed in tender tones those ceiling frescoes which Fragonard
had commenced in the house of Mdlle. Guimard. Capricious frivolities
had to make way for a manlier art, matter &ldquo;that was worthy to rivet the
gaze of a free nation upon itself.&rdquo; Already, long before the taking of the
Bastille, the painting of young David was valued by the rising generation
as the artistic embodiment of their political ideas, imbibed while they
were still at school. When the &ldquo;Horatii&rdquo; was completed it was not only
old Pompeo Battoni who exclaimed, when he saw the picture in David&rsquo;s
Roman studio, &ldquo;<i>Tu ed io soli siamo pittori, pel rimanente si puo gettarlo nel
fiume.</i>&rdquo; In Paris his success was universal; all the critics were unanimous
in praise; David was the man after the heart of the age, for his picture
was the first which spoke clearly and perceptibly of the pathos of the
revolution which stood at the threshold. People saw in it an &ldquo;example
of patriotism which knew no obstacles,&rdquo; since not even love for their sister,
who was betrothed to the enemy, prevailed upon the Horatii to refrain
from combat with the Curiati. His next picture, &ldquo;Brutus&rdquo; as he received
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>104</span>
the lictors, when they bring him the bodies of his sons who have
been implicated in a monarchical conspiracy, was greeted as allegorical of
the incorruptible justice of republicanism. The populace saw in it the
&ldquo;glorification of the chastisement of all traitors to liberty,&rdquo; and acclaimed
David because he &ldquo;had founded the sinewy style which should characterise
the heroic deeds of the revolutionaries, children of liberty, equality, and
fraternity.&rdquo; And one understands&mdash;when one also adds the influence of
Napoleon&mdash;this reaction of military simplicity against the effeminacy of
<i>rococo</i>.</p>

<p>David, at the outbreak of the Revolution, no longer a young man, but
forty years old, was the terrible painter of the age, its despotic dictator.
As a deputy in the Convention he not only ruled over painting, but also imposed
his taste upon sculpture, ivory work, goldsmiths&rsquo; work, and decoration.
He designed the new costumes for the deputies and ministers. As organiser of
public fêtes, he brought to life again the whole of republican Rome. He was
one of those rare artists who are the men of their hour. To a new plebeian
race, to whose feverishly excited patriotism the soft, luxurious, aristocratically
reprehensible art of <i>rococo</i> must seem as a mockery of all the rights of men,
he showed, for the first time, the man, the hero who died for an idea or for his
country; and he gave this man huge and elastic muscles, like those of a
gladiator who struggles in the arena. He was a second Hercules, cleansing the
Augæan stables; with his own strong shoulders he thrust back the petulant
band of painters who had tarried too long in the island of Cythera. He
applied art to the heroism of the day, gave it the martial attitude of patriotism,
inspired it with the spirit of Robespierre, St. Just, and Danton. The more
obtrusively his heroes paraded their patriotism, the more people saw in them
a picture of the French nation, as true as a transposition could hope to be.
This strained rhetorical pathos dwelt in the mind of the age. Talma moved
the people to enthusiasm when he played the &ldquo;Horatii&rdquo; of Corneille in
the classic cothurnus. When David painted, the state declamations of the
orators still rang in his ears. Robespierre is said to have spoken from the
tribune slowly, rhythmically, artistically: a Bossuet in his rostrum, a Boileau
in his chair, while the volcano quivered beneath his very feet: his
philippics were carefully divided into three sections, like academic discourses:
his patriotism resolved itself into tirades with correctly composed periods. In
David&rsquo;s pictures we have an exact correspondence with all this: the rigid
classicality of his composition, figures grouped as though on parade; his
cold pathos, the counterpart to that of the orators&rsquo; fine sentiments set
forth in fine phrases.</p>

<p>The great distinction between the beginning of modern art in Germany
and in France is that in France the new style was not only called forth
by the influence of a scientific programme from outside, but stood in conjunction
with a great transformation in culture, and that it was compelled
at first to concern itself not only with imitation and philological retrospect,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>105</span>
but with the free expression of the characteristically modern spirit. German
art had no new pronouncement to make through the medium of the antique;
it followed, on the other hand, the programme of an artistically barren
scholar who forgot that archæology is not art, recommended imitation as the
path to perfection, and perpetually reminded the artists who followed him how
widely they deviated from the correct lines of the model. &ldquo;Afterwards they
rebuke it, and say it is not antique and consequently not good art,&rdquo; as Albrecht
Dürer had complained of such people. In the earnest sentiment, the exalted
Roman spirit, the declaiming over rugged, masculine virtues, freedom and
patriotism, that found expression in David&rsquo;s first pictures, there lived something
of the Catonian spirit of the Terror; and that still gives them historical
value. His enthusiasm was not, first and foremost, for antique art, but
for the ideas of country, duty, freedom, progress. The words antiquity and
democracy were of like meaning to him.</p>

<p>And how thoroughly this man was permeated with the spirit of his age is
shown still more when he discarded the cothurnus, boldly attacked the present,
and gave himself up entirely to the delineation of what came under his direct
observation in his own life and experience. There he became not only a rhetorician,
a revolutionary agitator, but a really great painter. Lepelletier on his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>106</span>
death-bed, the assassinated Marat, and the dead Barre, are works of a mighty
<i>naturalist</i>. Lepelletier, one of the many deputies who had voted for the death
of Louis <span class="sc">XVI</span>, was treacherously assassinated in Paris, on 20th January 1793,
by a valet of the king&rsquo;s. The body was publicly exhibited; David painted it,
and on 29th March presented the picture to the Convention. As the portrait
of the &ldquo;first Martyr of Liberty,&rdquo; it was hung in the Convention chamber. On
13th July 1793 Marat, the man-of-terror, fell a victim to the knife of Charlotte
Corday. David was presiding at the Jacobin Club when the news was brought
him, and he embraced the citizen who had arrested the girl. Deputations of
the people appeared in the Convention to express their grief for the heavy
loss. Suddenly a voice was heard to cry: &ldquo;<i>Où es tu, David? Tu as transmis
à la posterité l&rsquo;image de Lepelletier mourant pour la patrie, il te reste encore un
tableau à faire.</i>&rdquo; Silence succeeded in the Assembly. Then David started
up: &ldquo;<i>Je le ferai.</i>&rdquo; On 11th October he informed the Convention that his
&ldquo;Marat&rdquo; was finished. &ldquo;The people asked for their murdered man back
again, longed to look once more on the features of their truest friend. They
cried to me: &lsquo;David, take up your brush, avenge Marat, so that the enemy
may blanch when they perceive the distorted countenance of the man who
became the victim of his love for freedom.&rsquo; I heard the voice of the people,
and obeyed.&rdquo; Thus David spoke in the Assembly when he presented the
Republic with the picture of the murdered man&mdash;one of the most thrilling
representations of that awful age. The body is lying in the bath. Only the
naked upper part of the body, and the head, with a dirty cloth tied round it,
and fallen back upon the right shoulder, are visible; one hand, resting back
on the side of the bath, still holds a paper in a convulsive grip; the other
hangs down limp and dead to the ground. Over this head, with the half-closed
eyelids, and the mouth distorted from the death-throes, Caravaggio
would have rejoiced, there is such keen naturalism in every stroke of the
brush. Like Géricault, in later times, David was then a regular visitor at the
Morgue, attended at executions, and took an interest in the convulsive
muscular movements of the guillotined. And the colour, too, like the drawing,
is of a naturalistic strength to which he never again attained. The light falls
slantingly on the corpse from above and throws the head, shoulder, and one
arm into strong relief, while all the rest is left in obscurity. In this awful <i>still-life</i>
of uncompromising reality and tragical grandeur he has created a work in the
midst of an age of storm which will survive all storms and all changes of taste.</p>

<p>His portraits have no less strikingly survived the fiery ordeal of time. In
them, too, he is neither rhetorical nor cold, but full of fire and the freshness of
youth. Face to face with his model, he forgot the Greeks and Romans,
saw life alone, was rejuvenated in the youth-giving fount of nature, and
painted&mdash;almost alone of the painters of his generation&mdash;the truth. Here
his effect, when otherwise he was lacking in all naïveté, is actually naïve and
intimate. The best painters have never treated flesh better. He had an
aversion to palette tones, and sought after nature with unexampled attention.
The fine pearl-grey of his colouring is as delicate as it is distinguished; in his
portraits, especially, the relief-tones of blue and light rose seem almost to
anticipate the delicate, toned-down tints of modern Impressionism. Himself
an ardent Revolutionist, he was, as it were, created to be the portrayer of
those men of an austerity like Cato&rsquo;s, and those women with their free,
masculine, proud gaze; that valiant generation that felt within itself a desire
to begin civilisation again and found religion anew. The portrait of Lavoisier
and his wife reminds one in its refinement of Madame Vigée-Lebrun. The
chemist is sitting by a table covered with instruments; his wife, in an elegant
light gown, bends attentively over him. The picture dates from 1788, and it
still looks like some good work of the age of Louis <span class="sc">XVI</span>. Again, how intimate
is the effect of the marvellous portrait of Michael Gérard and his family. The
good man, in his shirt-sleeves, seems to feel really at home; a small boy is
leaning against his knee, a girl is playing on the clavicorde. There is not the
slightest suggestion of pose or a conventional type of beauty in this stout old
gentleman sitting so comfortably in his <i>bourgeois négligé</i>, and with honest eyes
gazing out so inquisitively round him. In a few other pictures the spiritual
life of women is portrayed with remarkable tenderness. One of the earliest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>110</span>
is the exceptionally fine portrait of his mother-in-law, Madame Pécoult, in
1783; then, in 1790, the portrait of the Marquise d&rsquo;Orvilliers, with that
expression of dreamy languor which plays round the eyes of the beautiful
woman. The Louvre possesses, in the portrait of Madame Récamier, perhaps
the most charming and attractive woman&rsquo;s portrait that David ever painted.
The beautiful Juliette lies stretched on a divan of antique pattern. She
wears a white dress, her soft rosy feet are bare. The arrangement of the room
coquettes primly with that simplicity which was paraded at the time. Apart
from the divan, there is only a huge bronze candelabra to be seen. Then there
is Barere&rsquo;s portrait. He stands on the tribune, and delivers the speech which
is to cost Louis <span class="sc">XVI</span> his life. The face is small and insignificant, the gaze
cold and harsh, and on the mouth there is a shadow of bitter hate and narrow
fanaticism. But the triumph of these portraits of men is that of Bonaparte.
David was one of the first of the men of the Revolution to come beneath the
spell of the Little Corporal. One day, while he was working in his studio at
the Louvre, a pupil rushed in breathlessly: &ldquo;General Bonaparte is outside
the door!&rdquo; Napoleon entered in a dark-blue coat &ldquo;that made his lean
yellow face look leaner and yellower than ever.&rdquo; David dismissed his pupils,
and drew, in a sitting of barely two hours, the stern head of the Corsican. Thus
he passed into the service of Napoleon.</p>

<p>This man, who viewed himself only as the coping-stone of the Republic&mdash;after
the example of Augustus when he transformed the Roman Republic
into the Empire&mdash;was unwilling to show any opposition to the republican
tastes. The first painter of the Republic was appointed to be the Imperial
Court painter. What he had been under Robespierre he was under Napoleon:
the dictator of his age, who maintained a supremacy over the whole of art
similar to that which Lebrun held beneath Louis <span class="sc">XIV</span>. The &ldquo;Marat&rdquo; was
the great work of his revolutionary, the &ldquo;Coronation&rdquo; of his monarchical
period,&mdash;that colossal picture which, completed between 1806 and 1807, has
handed down to posterity a true representation of the ceremonial pageants
that took place in Notre Dame on 2nd December 1804. The moment selected
is when Napoleon places the crown, which is carried on a velvet cushion by
the Duc de Berg, upon the head of the Empress, who kneels before him in a
white robe and a crimson mantle. The picture contains portraits of all the
personages present at the ceremony, amongst them being David himself, as he
stands on a platform and sketches at a small table. The whole composition of
this picture and the grouping of the figures is full of stately gravity. Real
energy and patience must have been required to paint this immense picture,
though it shows not the least sign of fatigue. With the exception of Menzel&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Coronation of William <span class="sc">I</span>,&rdquo; I know of no historical picture of the century of as
high an artistic value, with the like noble sublimity of colour, with so tender,
quivering a light. There are certain portions of the &ldquo;Coronation&rdquo; in which
the white robes, the deep-red velvet of the mantles, and gold embroideries affect
us like a symphony in colours. When the picture was completed Napoleon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>111</span>
visited David&rsquo;s studio, accompanied by the Empress, his ministers, and his
staff. The Court drew up, and the Emperor moved up and down in front of
the picture, hat in hand, for more than half an hour, examining it in all its
details. Finally, with one of those dramatic effects of which he was so fond,
he lightly raised his hat: &ldquo;<i>C&rsquo;est bien, très bien; David, je vous salue</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>David had now still better opportunities than at an earlier period of
proving his great capacity as a portrait painter. His portraits of the
Emperor, of the Pope, of Cardinal Caprara, and of Murat symbolise the
brutal greatness of an age which worshipped strength. Even at the close
of his life, when the Restoration had exiled him from France, there resulted
in Brussels graceful and tenderly observed portraits, such as that of the daughter
of Joseph Bonaparte, which will perpetuate his name. One, in the Praet
Collection at Brussels&mdash;three women of indescribable ugliness&mdash;marks the
pinnacle of his pictorial strength and keen naturalism. They are the &ldquo;Three
Fates&rdquo; of 1810, and he has painted them with the true artist&rsquo;s delight, and
with a massiveness like that of Frans Hals.</p>

<p>When these works were brought together at the Paris Exhibition of 1889,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>112</span>
universal astonishment prevailed when it was discovered what a great painter
this Louis David was. He appeared in these pictures as an artist who stood completely
within his age, who shared its passions and was permeated by its greatness;
he even appeared as a <i>charmeur</i> who handled the phenomena of colour
and light as few others have done. It is true, David showed himself in this
favourable light at the exhibition only because the entirely archæological
side of his talent was not represented. For at the bottom of his heart he too
was an archæologist. Many of his works, such as &ldquo;The Death of Socrates,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Brutus,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Oath in the Tennis Court,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Rape of the Sabines,&rdquo;
are specimens of a barren theory.</p>

<p>Against all the caprice of the eighteenth century, with its charming, alluring
grace, he opposed a strict, inexorable system, as he believed he saw it in the
antique. Simplicity, however, beneath his hands became dryness, nobility
formal. He saw in painting a sort of abstract geometry for which there
existed hard-and-fast forms. There was something mathematical in
his effort after dry correctness and erudite accuracy. The infinite variety
of life with its eternal changes was hidden from his sight. The beautiful,
he taught with Winckelmann, does not exist in a single individual; it is
only possible to create a type of it by comparison and through composition.
The human being of art ought always to be a copy of that perfect being,
primitive man, whom the Roman sculptors had still before their eyes,
but who had deteriorated in the course of ages. Thus in France, too, the
sensuous art of painting was converted into an abstract science of æsthetics.
The classic ideal weighed upon French art and prescribed for all alike the
same &ldquo;heroic style,&rdquo; the same elevation, the same marble coldness and
monotony of colour. <i>Jean-Baptiste Regnault</i>, and <i>François André Vincent</i>, whose
studios were most frequented after David&rsquo;s, worshipped the same gods. After
David&rsquo;s departure, <i>Guérin</i>, in particular, endeavoured to bequeath to the
students those genuinely academic rules which his pupil, Delacroix, has
summed up in these words: &ldquo;In order to make an ideal head of a negro,
our teachers make him resemble as far as possible the profile of Antinous, and
then say, &lsquo;We have done our utmost; if he is, nevertheless, not beautiful,
we must altogether abstain from this freak of nature, with his squat nose
and thick lips, so unendurable to the eyes.&rsquo;&rdquo; When he had to paint his
&ldquo;Insurrection in Cairo,&rdquo; therefore, Egyptians as well as Arabs must first be
supplied with heads of Antinous and transformed from modern soldiers into
ancient warriors, Romans of the time of Romulus, before they could enter
into the kingdom of art. Everything was sacrificed to line,&mdash;an inflexible,
inexorable, correct, and icy line, the conventional, ideal line,&mdash;not the true
line which follows from observation of the infinite variety of nature.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, even in works constructed as these were by rule and line,
we cannot fail to be impressed by the technical ability displayed by the artist.</p>

<p>France, who in her outward relations has generally had a feverish longing
for change, has been in literary and artistic respects, as a rule, exceedingly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>113</span>
conservative, has upheld authority,
supported an academy, and
prized limitations and proportion
above everything. They had
upset the monarchy, murdered
the hated aristocrats, built up
the republic, done away with
Christianity before they ever
thought of touching the three
unities of the drama. Voltaire,
who had a reverence for nothing
in heaven or earth, respected the
received treatment of the Alexandrine
verse. And David, the
great painter of the Revolution,
who cast the pictures of Boucher
out of the Louvre, and whose
pupils used to shoot bread-crumbs
at Watteau&rsquo;s masterpiece,
the &ldquo;Voyage à Cythère,&rdquo;
yet conveyed with him into the
new age, as an inheritance from
<i>rococo</i>, its prodigious knowledge.
The good old traditions of the
technique of French painting
were little shaken by him and his school. The Academy described by
Quatremère as the &ldquo;eternal nursery garden of incurable prejudices,&rdquo;
was indeed overthrown, but David became immediately the head of a
new one. This age of absorption in politics developed an art to correspond,
more disciplined than ever, girt round by an iron cuirass; and
this art, notwithstanding multifarious phases, at no time lost its touch,
technically, with the acquisitions of former epochs, but evolved itself
in its various directions from one centre, distracted from its path by
nothing brought into it from outside. Géricault, Delacroix, Courbet, and
Manet, widely as they differ from one another, are links in one chain of
evolution. Art comes from knowledge. This maxim, which David held
in honour, has remained to the present day a dominant force in French art,
and by virtue of this knowledge, which David received from the old masters
and guarded as a sacred trust, France became in the nineteenth century
the chief school of technique for all other nations. From the French the
other nations learned their grammar and syntax; through them they
acquired a wider horizon and a deeper insight into the great mystery of
nature.</p>

<p class="center chap2">THE NAZARENES</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">Herein</span> lies the great difference between France and Germany. Although
following along new lines, the art of France did not thereby suffer as
regards the quality of its execution; in spite of all Classicism it remained
the disciplined art of the schools. These favourable preliminaries were
lacking in Germany. It was not allotted to German painting to grow up in
naïve contentment with the technical inheritance of its forefathers, but, on
the contrary, at the entrance of its new career it broke so completely with its
predecessor&mdash;the art of the eighteenth century&mdash;that it could no longer adopt
even its technical traditions. It arose out of the negation of earlier art, an
absolute negation such as the world had never seen before. It began with
a self-made man who had never acquired the charter of craftsmanship, who
never learnt to paint. In France, revolutionary pictures inspired with
intense pathos, and frankly naturalistic portraits of masterly technique;
with Carstens, outlines showing refined feeling, but faulty very generally
in execution, sketches drawn roughly with the pencil, crayon, or red
chalk.</p>

<p>It had taken many generations of painters, whose lives had been spent in
careful devotion to the work, to collect the technical capital which Carstens so
carelessly flung to the winds.</p>

<p>The next step along this way was taken by the Nazarenes.</p>

<p>Just as it was inevitable that cold and lifeless Classicism should follow
the brightness and animation of <i>rococo</i>, so it was necessary, according
to the law of extremes which alternate in every evolution of culture, that,
next to the antique, should come its exact opposite, the Gothic or Middle
Ages. The antique was so monotonous that people longed for variety
of colour again; it was so cold and statuesque that they longed for something
soulful, so Greek and pagan and severe that they hankered again after
something Christian, would believe again like children.</p>

<p>Even in the young days of the old pagan, Goethe, religion formed the
favourite topic of the <i>beaux esprits</i>, and in the same year, 1797, that Carstens
died, this cult of the emotional life found, for the first time, expression in
literature. In every library one finds a dainty, finely printed book in small
octavo, without the author&rsquo;s name, with the title <i>Herzensergiessungen eines
Kunstliebenden Klosterbruders</i>, and with a sort of head of Raphael as a frontispiece,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>118</span>
in which, with his prominent eyes, full lips, and long neck, he looks like
some intellectual, Christ-inspired, consumptive enthusiast. It is the pale,
gentle face of Wackenroder.</p>

<p>First Winckelmann, then Wackenroder. In the very personalities of
these two the whole opposition between Classicism and the Nazarenes is
reflected. A student barely twenty years old, a mild, modest, contemplative
soul, who had attached himself from early youth with womanly devotion
to his more energetic friend Tieck, and written letters to him that read
like a young girl&rsquo;s effusions to her sweetheart, he entered the Erlanger
University with his friend at the Easter of 1793. They saw Nuremberg.
More than once they made pilgrimages to the old fashioned town, the treasury
of German art; and the spirit of the past powerfully inspired them.
Whilst for Lessing and Winckelmann &ldquo;Gothic&rdquo; art only meant barbarian
art, the wonders of Nuremberg were now observed with fresh eyes. In
a sort of intoxication of art the friends wandered through churches,
stood by the graves of Albrecht Dürer and Peter Vischer, and a vanished
world rose before them. The spires and turrets behind falling walls and
ramparts, the old, stately, patrician houses, which jutted out their oriel
windows, as it were with curiosity, into the crooked streets, were peopled to
their imagination with picturesque figures in bonnet and hose from that great
time when Nuremberg was &ldquo;the living, swarming school of native art,&rdquo; when
&ldquo;an exuberant, artistic spirit&rdquo; governed within its walls, when Master Hans
Sachs and Adam Kraft and Peter Vischer and Albrecht Dürer and Willibald
Pirkheymer were alive. Shortly after that they came to Dresden, and devoted
themselves in the gallery there to an enthusiastic cult of the Madonna.
The <i>Herzensergiessungen eines Kunstliebenden
Klosterbruders</i>, which appeared
a year before Wackenroder&rsquo;s death in
his twenty-sixth year, was the result
of these wanderings and studies. In
this tender production of a visionary
youth the spirit of Romantic art found
expression.</p>

<p>Winckelmann was an archæologist;
Wackenroder, an enthusiast of the
Middle Ages; on the one side knowledge
only, on the other all feeling;
for the one, paganism, for the other,
Christ. For it is from the first a
leading principle of the &ldquo;<i>Klosterbruder</i>,&rdquo;
that &ldquo;the finest stream of
life only issues from the streams of
art and religion when they flow in
company.&rdquo; He valued the older
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page119" id="page119"></a>119</span>
painters &ldquo;because they had made painting the true handmaid of religion&rdquo;;
art was to him an object of devotion. Picture galleries, he says, ought
to be temples; he would liken the enjoyment of works of art to prayer;
let it be a holy feast day to him if he go with a serious and composed
mind to their observance; indeed, reverence for art and reverence for God
were so closely interwoven that he was fain to kneel down before
art, and offer it the homage of an &ldquo;eternal and boundless love.&rdquo; This devotion
to art, of which he himself was full, he found nowhere in his times. The
age of enlightenment was to him an undevout and inartistic age. Only in
his wanderings through the uneven streets of Nuremberg did the deepest
yearning of his soul seem satisfied. He applied himself to mediæval, and
especially to German art. His standpoint is the same which the young Goethe
had adopted when he intervened with Herder for &ldquo;German style and art,&rdquo;
and dedicated his pamphlet on German architecture to the shade of Erwin
von Steinbach. He is reluctant that one should condemn the Middle Ages
because they did not build such temples as the Greeks, any more than that one
should condemn the Indians because they spoke their language and not our own.
&ldquo;It is not only beneath Italian skies, under majestic domes and Corinthian
columns, that true art thrives, it lives too under pointed arches, intricately

<p>It was all said so simply and heartily that soon the whole world began
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>120</span>
to be &ldquo;Wackenroderite.&rdquo; The ingenious and enthusiastic youth was succeeded
by theoretic reasoners. Tieck, who published his <i>Phantasies upon Art</i> in
1799, after Wackenroder&rsquo;s death, and amplified it with his own explanations,
was no longer a genuine but a counterfeit &ldquo;<i>Klosterbruder</i>.&rdquo; He first played
with Catholicism, and uttered the momentous sentence: &ldquo;The best of the
later masters up to the most recent times have had no other aim than to
imitate some one of the primitive or typical artists, or even several together;
nor have they easily become great by any other method than by having
successfully imitated somebody.&rdquo; His <i>Sternbald</i> is still more haunted by the
spirit of monastic devotion.</p>

<p>The particular starting-point was in this case too, as it had been before
for Winckelmann, the Dresden Gallery, where, at the turn of the century,
Augustus William and Frederick Schlegel, the two &ldquo;<i>Gotter-buben</i>,&rdquo; held their
cultured rendezvous. &ldquo;The Schlegels had taken possession of the gallery,&rdquo;
wrote Dora Stock, &ldquo;and with Schelling and Gries spent almost every morning
there. It was a joy to see them writing and teaching there. Sometimes
they talked to me about art. I felt myself often quite paltry, I was so far
from any wisdom. Fichte, too, they initiated into their secrets. You would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id="page121"></a>121</span>
have laughed if you could have seen them drag him about and assail him
with their convictions.&rdquo; The journal <i>Europa</i>, founded by Frederick Schlegel
in 1803, became the rallying-point of the new movement, and his articles
published therein contained the germs of all the efforts and errors of the young
school. In his discourse on Raphael he compares the pre-Raphaelite period
with that succeeding it, and considers the proposition that &ldquo;indubitably the
corruption of art was originally brought about by the newer school which
was marked by Raphael, Titian, Correggio, Giulio Romano, and Michael
Angelo&rdquo; so unquestionable that he does not find it in the least necessary
to prove it. He casually puts forward as an <i>obiter dictum</i> dropped in amongst
a series of quite opposed notions the idea that every art ought to have a
national foundation, and that any imitation of a foreign form of art is deleterious.
The result follows that it is to be deplored &ldquo;that an evil genius
has alienated artists from the circle of ideas and the subjects of the old painters.
Culture can only attach itself to what has been constituted. How natural
it would be, then, if painters were to go on in the old way, and cast themselves
anew into the ideas and disposition of the old painters.&rdquo; The artist should
follow the painters prior to Raphael, &ldquo;especially the oldest,&rdquo; should strive to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122"></a>122</span>
&ldquo;copy carefully their truth and simplicity long enough for it to become
second nature to his eye&rdquo;; or he may &ldquo;select the style of the old German
school as a pattern.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The latter counsel originated from the discovery in 1804 of the
Cologne Cathedral picture, referred to by Schlegel in his <i>Europa</i>.
Through the secularisation of the monasteries, attention was again
directed to the old ecclesiastical pictures which people had hitherto passed
by unnoticed. From the monasteries, churches, guild halls, and castles
which the French had plundered, countless masses of paintings of every
sort were extricated. A great deal perished; nearly all, however, that had
hitherto been kept as heirlooms, and for the most part almost inaccessible,
now became movable, attainable property. The brothers Boisserée began
their celebrated collection, which is to be seen to-day in the Munich <i>Pinakothek</i>.
While hitherto one had, at the most, known of Dürer, now one
touched upon an age which lay behind the Reformation, an age in which
Catholicism was flourishing, in which &ldquo;not great artists but nameless monks
represented art,&rdquo; and it was soon all fire and ardour over the sweetness,
naïveté, and faith of these pictures. Fernow had still pronounced generally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page123" id="page123"></a>123</span>
against the capacity of the &ldquo;Catholic religion, with its Jewish-Christian
mythology and martyrology,&rdquo; to satisfy the demands of a pure taste in art.
Carstens had written down for himself the sentence from Webb&rsquo;s work:
&ldquo;The art of the ancients was rich in august and captivating figures: their
gods had grace, majesty, and beauty. How much meaner is the lot of the
moderns! Their art is subservient to the priests. Their characters are
taken from the lowest spheres of life&mdash;men of humble descent and uncouth
manners. Even their Divine Master is in painting nowhere to be seen according
to a great idea; His long, smooth hair, His Jewish beard and sickly appearance
would deprive the most exalted beings of any semblance of dignity. Meekness
and humility, His characteristic traits, are virtues edifying in the extreme
but in no way picturesque. This lack of dignity in the subject renders it
intelligible why we look so coldly at these works in the churches and galleries.
The genius of painting expends its strength in vain on Crucifixions, Holy
Families, Last Suppers, and the like.&rdquo; Not five years had elapsed after
Carstens&rsquo; death when, according to an impression of Dorothea Veit, &ldquo;Christianity
was once more the order of the day.&rdquo; William Schlegel&rsquo;s poem,
<i>The Church&rsquo;s Alliance with the Arts</i>, from which, later, Overbeck borrowed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page124" id="page124"></a>124</span>
the thought for his picture, can be looked upon, as Goethe already wrote,
as the true profession of faith of the young school. Where previously
Augustus William had described in his sonnets the Io, Leda, and Cleopatra
of the Dresden Gallery, it was now the Madonna who received the homage of
the gallant poet. By Frederick, Christianity was recommended to the artist
as a formal model and a source of æsthetic enjoyment,&mdash;as it was, at the
same time, by Chateaubriand as <i>prédilection d&rsquo;artiste</i>.</p>

<p>Even more profound did the tendency become during the War of Independence,
which at the same time gave the death blow to Classicism. Distress
taught how to pray. In those years of humiliation the young generation
abandoned the classic ideal for ever, and Schenkendorf cried imperiously:
&ldquo;We would see no more pagan pictures on any German walls.&rdquo; French
&ldquo;frivolity&rdquo; was contrasted with German seriousness, German Christianity
with the free-thought of the French; there was a return from the cold philosophy
of enlightenment to the vigorous feeling of mediæval faith.</p>

1799:&mdash;</p>

become true, that the German artist has either no character at all or he must
have the character of the mediæval masters, true-hearted and thoughtful,
innocent withal, and somewhat maladroit. In architecture the Hellenic
school is succeeded by the Gothic, painting passes from the reverence of the
Greek statues to that of old Italian pictures.</p>

<p>Rome remained for the Nazarenes, too,
the centre of influence, only they no longer
made pilgrimages, like the Classicists, to
ancient but to Christian Rome. <i>Overbeck</i>
of Lübeck came in 1810 with Pforr of Frankfort
and Vogel of Zürich; the Düsseldorfer,
Cornelius, followed in 1811, <i>Schadow</i> and
<i>Veit</i> of Berlin in 1815, <i>Schnorr von Carolsfeld</i>
of Leipzig in 1818, the Viennese <i>Führich</i> and
<i>Steinle</i> in 1827 and 1828. In all of them
there lived the perception that in such a
serious age men should be of high moral
endeavour, and art the expression of the
religious capacity of their lives.</p>

<p>There still stands to-day, on a secluded
hillock of the Monte Pincio a small church,
whose façade is adorned with the statues of St. Isidore, the patron of
husbandmen, and of St. Patrick, apostle of Ireland. A court with weather-beaten
cloisters and an old well separates the church from the monastery
which lies behind it, where the cells of the monks, Irish and Italian Franciscans,
are placed. Above, on the terrace of the house, one has a charming view
of Rome and the Campagna, of Monte Cavo and the heights of Tusculum.
Below stretch the gardens of the Capucin Convent, and farther back the
grounds and avenues of the Villa Ludovisi. On the first floor is a large hall,
the walls of which have been decorated by the hand of some old monk with
frescoes, and which, formerly a refectory, is used to-day as a theological
lecture-room. This was the room where Overbeck and his friends in the
first period after their arrival
stood for one another as models.
Lethière, the director of the
French Academy, had obtained
permission for them to install
themselves in the deserted
rooms of the monastery of
San Isidoro, which had been
spared by Napoleon, for which
they paid the small sum of
three scudi monthly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We led a truly monastic
life,&rdquo; relates Overbeck; &ldquo;held
ourselves aloof from all, and
lived only for art. In the
morning we marketed together;
at midday we took it in turns
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id="page126"></a>126</span>
to cook our dinner, which was composed of nothing but a soup and a
pudding, or some tasty vegetable, and was seasoned only by earnest conversation
on art.&rdquo; Overbeck, as a good housekeeper, kept accounts;
the principal items of the daily outlay occurred for polenta and risotto,
oranges and lemons; every now and then oil, too, was noted down. The
afternoons were dedicated to the study of the creations of art in Rome.
With &ldquo;beating hearts and holy awe&rdquo; they passed over the threshold of the
<i>Stanze</i>. In the chapel of San Lorenzo they became &ldquo;familiar with the
seraphic Fiesole, whose frescoes transcend everything in purity of conception.&rdquo;
They shunned the paganism of St. Peter&rsquo;s, and marvelled with all the more
intimate devotion at the old Christian monuments. The churches of San
Lorenzo and San Clemente, the cloisters of St. John Lateran and St. Paul&rsquo;s-without-the-Walls,
made an ineffaceable impression upon the young men.
At the twilight hour they wandered up on to Monte Cavo. &ldquo;And of evenings
we drew studies of drapery&mdash;glorious folds!&mdash;from Pforr&rsquo;s big Venetian
mantle, in which we took turns to pose for one another.&rdquo; Their whole
hearts, however, first swelled when they undertook a journey to Tuscany.
In Orvieto, Luca Signorelli awaited them, whose frescoes especially impressed
Cornelius mightily. At Sienna they found teachers who were still
more sympathetic to them, Duccio and Simone Martino, those masters of
a tender, intimate spirit and a charming sweetness of expression. In the
Campo Santo at Pisa they turned their attention to Fiesole&rsquo;s pupil,
Gozzoli. Those became their great teachers in art. &ldquo;Just as ardent
Christians wander to the grave of the princes of the apostles in order to
confirm their faith and quicken
their zeal, so should zealous young
artists derive strength and illumination
from the silent and yet so
eloquent speech of the sublime
geniuses of art. An artist of real
worth will find in the masterpieces
of painting at Rome everything
necessary for him in order
to reach the right path. But, to
be sure, a well-made plait of
hair does not certainly constitute
one a Raphael, because Raphael,
too, arranged his hair with feeling.
Study alone leads to nothing. If
since Raphael&rsquo;s age, as one can
almost declare, there has been no
painter, that is the fault of nothing
else than of the fact that art has
been vanquished by workmanship.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id="page127"></a>127</span>
One learnt at the academies to paint excellent drapery, to draw a correct
figure, learnt perspective, architecture&mdash;in short, everything, and yet
no painter was produced. There is one want in all recent painting&mdash;heart,
soul, sentiment. Let the young painter then watch, before everything,
over his sentiments: let him allow neither an impure word on
his lips nor an impure thought in his mind. But how can he guard
himself from that? By religion, by study of the Bible, the one and
only study which made Raphael. This view now certainly contradicts
the accustomed principles that everything must be systematically
learnt; mere learning produces certainly an instructed but also a cold
artist. On that ground it is not good either to study anatomy from
dead bodies, because one dwarfs thereby certain fine sensibilities, or to
work from female models, for the same reason. Let the painter be inspired
by his subject as those of old were, and the result will be the same.
Like those old painters, let every artist remind himself that the truest
use of art is that which leads it heavenwards, its one function that of
having a moral effect upon men.&rdquo; &ldquo;How pure and holy,&rdquo; cries Cornelius
to Xeller, as late as 1858, &ldquo;was the end at which we aimed! Unknown,
without encouragement, without aid, except that of our loving Father in
heaven.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is obvious that between the ascetics of the monastery and the
Classicists direct friction must ensue. To them the &ldquo;ever repeated and
pale reflexions of Greek sculpture&rdquo; said nothing, while the Classicists
scoffed at the religionists, for whom the sarcastic brawler, Reinhart, invented
the nickname of &ldquo;Nazarenes,&rdquo;
which has since become a watchword.
The opposition was historically immortalised
when Bunsen, the Prussian
envoy, invited the whole colony to the
christening of his little daughter, and
Niebuhr touched glasses with Thorwaldsen
&ldquo;to the health of old Jupiter.&rdquo;
Only Cornelius joined in; the others
started and looked upon the young
Düsseldorfer as a heretic.</p>

<p>This positive Christian standpoint,
which allowed art to be esteemed
only as a religious service, pictures
only as a means of ecclesiastical edification,
irritated also the old man of
Weimar at the first start. The effort
of the Nazarenes to make piety the
foundation of true artistic activity was
to him a continual subject of contempt.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128"></a>128</span>
Religion no more bestows talent for the arts than it gives taste.
He spoke with irony of the &ldquo;valiant artists and ingenious friends of
art who had resort to the honourable, naïve, yet somewhat coarse
taste&rdquo; of the fourteenth and fifteenth-century masters. He constantly
employed of them the expression &ldquo;star-gazing.&rdquo; He had already
mockingly remarked of Wackenroder&rsquo;s <i>Herzensergiessungen</i> what an
unwarrantable conclusion it was, that because a few monks were artists,
all artists should therefore be monks. He called the life of the Nazarenes
&ldquo;a sort of masquerade which stood in opposition to the actual day,&rdquo;
and wrote in the pages of <i>Art and Antiquity</i> that manifesto, the <i>New
German Religious-Patriotic Art</i>, or <i>History of the New Pietistic False Art
since the Eighties</i>, which so deeply wounded the young enthusiasts. &ldquo;The
doctrine was that the artist needed piety above everything to equal
the work of the best. What an attractive doctrine! How eagerly
we should accept it! For in order to become religious one need learn
nothing.&rdquo; The whole movement reached nothing beyond a slavish
imitation of Giotto and his immediate followers. Of course, it was
inconsistent of Goethe to reproach contemporary art for imitating that
of the Middle Ages, and to praise the latter only when it imitated
the antique. Speaking as a man of Mengs&rsquo; school, and merely proposing
Hellenic art as a canon instead of early Italian, he had, after all, no
right to be angry if Frederick Schlegel opposed classical models with
mediæval. Otherwise, however, even to-day little can be added to Goethe&rsquo;s
animadversions.</p>

<p>As with Carstens, so with the Nazarenes, we are warned by the idealistic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129"></a>129</span>
tendency which inspired the young enthusiasts. There are but few painters
with whom life and art have been in such complete agreement as with
the gentle, mild, and modest Overbeck, the &ldquo;Apostle John,&rdquo; as he got
to be called, that young man, that serene soul who looked upon art
simply as a harp of David for the praise of the Lord, to whom the
&ldquo;hope that through his works one soul had been strengthened in faith
and piety was of far more value than any fame,&rdquo; and who ended at last
in a sort of religious mania. With the Nazarenes, too, as with the
Classicists, it was pure exaltation which drove them to free themselves
from the trammels of the school, in order to get back from dead
fabrications to creations of art, which, proceeding out of the living
spirit, once more had a soul. Even the much-despised conversion of the
Protestants among them to the Catholic Church arose out of the
deep conviction that they also, as well as their art, must be united in
religion.</p>

<p>In a certain sense they even show an advance in art. They found
between themselves and the great painters of the eighteenth century a
gulf that could no longer be spanned. After Carstens had thrown
overboard every colouristic acquisition, it was indeed something that the
Nazarenes no longer saw the highest aim of painting in black and white
design, but turned, though with timidity and hesitation, to the study of
the Italian Quattrocento with its joyous delight in colour, and so became
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page130" id="page130"></a>130</span>
the first real painters after the cartoon period. Only that was as yet
simply an advance for the nineteenth century, and not especially for the
history of art. This was as little enriched with new forms and discoveries
by the Nazarenes as by the Classicists. The former, too, were imitators,
and only changed masters when they fled from the antique to the
Middle Ages, and copied the old Italians in lieu of the Greeks. The
Classicists had imitated with a certain cold erudition; the Nazarenes out
of the depths of their emotion. As the former used Greeks, so did they
use the fourteenth-century painters, as patterns of calligraphy from which
they made their copies, cut their stencils after the Italian form, and, like
Mengs, were able to reproduce in their works only a very weak reflection
of those departed spirits. As eclectics they would stand on the same rung
with the academics of Bologna, except that the ideal of the latter school
was a combination from Leonardo, Raphael, Michael Angelo, Correggio,
and Titian, and that it possessed an incomparably greater facility in
technique.</p>

<p>The Nazarenes abandoned on principle the employment of the model,
from fear lest it might entice them away from the ideal representation
of the character to be depicted. They sought in a dilettante manner to
supply the control over the material which alone makes the artist, by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page131" id="page131"></a>131</span>
enthusiasm for the material. Only Cornelius dared to draw from the
female form. Overbeck refused to do so, from modesty. The Virgin
Mary was to him the highest ideal of womanhood, the paler, the more
virtuous, the more akin to the Lamb of God; and he would have
deemed it a sacrilege to have depicted her as purely womanly. They
therefore only occasionally sat to one another for studies of drapery, and,
for the rest, &ldquo;in order not to be naturalistic,&rdquo; painted their pictures from
imagination in the seclusion of their cells. As the Catholicism of Schlegel
was an anæmic system, so the painters, too, deprived their figures of blood
and being in order to leave them only the abstract beauty of line. They
are beings who are exalted above everything, even above correctness of
drawing, and who must expire of a lack of blood in their veins. The
command, &ldquo;Seek ye therefore first the kingdom of God, and His righteousness,
and all these things shall be added unto you,&rdquo; was carried out by the
Nazarenes only too well.</p>

<p>When the intelligence of
the Battle of Waterloo had
penetrated even into the
silent cells of the monks,
they believed that art too
should participate in this
universal elevation, and become
a factor again in the
development of the German
nation. It must not be
used, wrote Cornelius in his
famous letter to Görres, as
a mere plaything, or to
tickle the senses, not merely
for the delectation and
pomp of high and rich
Maecenases, but for the ennoblement
and glorification
of public life. The means
of this artistic elevation,
and at the same time a new
means of popular culture,
was to be the introduction
of fresco painting.</p>

<p>And thus the Brothers of
San Isidoro re-discovered
what had, as a matter of
fact, always been quietly
practiced by the &ldquo;rustics
painters,&rdquo; but since Mengs&rsquo;
time had no longer been employed by the &ldquo;art painters,&rdquo; and had
been forgotten for half a century. The Prussian consul at Rome, Bartholdy,
gave them the commission. An old mason, who had last arranged
wall-plastering under Mengs, was recruited as technical adviser; Carl
Eggers, of Neustrelitz, zealously made chemical researches; and it is said
to have been Veit who, at Cornelius&rsquo; request (&ldquo;Now, Philip, you make
the first attempt!&rdquo;), was the first to paint the portrait of a head in
fresco, whilst his companions looked on with amazement and delight.
Then the others set to work, &ldquo;and painted away at it in the name of
God.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, believe me, my friend, it is a desperate matter to paint

<p>The frescoes represent, in six mural paintings and two lunettes, the
history of Joseph in Egypt, from his sale to his recognition by his
brethren. The two latter are the work of Cornelius and Overbeck,
the others of Veit and Schadow. The work was prolonged through
many years, interrupted by manifold difficulties, and when one stands
to-day before the transferred pictures in the Berlin National Gallery
one cannot refrain from admiring them.</p>

<p>There lives within them an unpretentiousness and sincerity of sentiment,
and, in spite of all deficiencies and lack of independence, somewhat of
that lofty inspiration which raises the pictures of really earnest artists,
even if they are faulty, far above any fabricated productions. An association
of young men, which, unconcerned about success and material profit,
contended only for ideal products, found here for the first time an
opportunity to display what it wanted. In the interpretation of Pharaoh&rsquo;s
dream and in the recognition by the brethren, Cornelius, in formal language,
full of character, and without any phrases and posture, displayed all
that he had derived from the great
Italians in nobility of grouping
and fine arrangement of lines.
Overbeck reaches the same height
in his allegory of the seven lean
kine. But it is not only as youthful
works of artists, who, if they belonged
to a period of decadence,
yet were, withal, the greatest representatives
of a period of German
art, that these pictures are worthy
of high esteem; they are essentially
the best that these masters have
created. Cornelius, notably, shows
a study, a care for execution, indeed
even a harmony of colouring, that
stands in surprising opposition to
his later negligence. From the conception
that the artistic performance
is determined in the invention, and
the design, but that the pictorial execution
is an indifferent, mechanical
accessory which could be supplied
even by other people, he was at
that time still free.</p>

<p>When the pictures had been unveiled in 1819 a festival of German
artists was held in Rome. Rückert, Bunsen, the Humboldts, the Herzes
were there; Cornelius, Veit, and Overbeck had arranged the transparencies.
&ldquo;The centre of all,&rdquo; writes the Danish romantic Atterbom, was the
Crown Prince Ludwig of Bavaria, &ldquo;the idol of every German artist, whose
ruling passion is for the fine arts and fair ladies. Everything was in
old German masques, the ladies in wide ruffs. The Crown Prince was in
the utmost good humour, and treated the artists as his equals. A toast
was drunk to German unity. The scene struck me like a beautiful dream
out of the Middle Ages.&rdquo; German unity at a Roman fancy ball! The
German nation a beautiful dream out of the Middle Ages! The Crown
Prince Ludwig, when he took Cornelius and Schnorr out of the Roman
circle, at least created a fatherland for German art, and later on the
others also found at home a suitable sphere of activity.</p>

<p>Philip Veit, who went to Frankfort in 1830 as Director of the Staedel
Institute, was the first to settle down, and for all his energy could only for a
very short time make that city into a seat of the Christian tendency in art.
Of his pictures there, the fresco painted for the Staedel Institute, &ldquo;The
Introduction of Christianity into Germany by St. Boniface,&rdquo; is by far the
most important. The apostle has hewn down the oak of Thor, and from
where it once stood there flows forth the new spring of Christianity. The
old Germans shrink back timorously, but the youths listen to the preacher,
and follow his direction to the figure of religion which approaches with the
palm of peace. In the background a church rises, and in the distance, by
a limpid river, a flourishing town, in contrast to the sombre, primeval
forest to which the Germans who reject religion are flying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>135</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The two Marys at the Sepulchre,&rdquo; in the Berlin National Gallery,
and the &ldquo;Assumption,&rdquo; in the Frankfort Cathedral, date from a later
period. It was of no avail to him that he mingled with his Nazarenism
a certain air of the world, which found expression in a less ascetic
language of form and a somewhat stronger sense of colour. In 1841 he
had already a feeling that the restless, struggling age had passed him by.
He abandoned his post and went to meet oblivion as Director of the
Gallery at Mayence.</p>

<p>Overbeck, the only one who could not tear himself from Rome, remained,
till his death in 1869, the &ldquo;Young German Raphael,&rdquo; as his father
had called him in a letter from Lübeck in 1811: a devout, religious
poet, pure of soul and of fine culture, as one-coloured and one-sided as he
was mild and tender. At the outset he knew, at least, how to extract
from the old masters a certain naïve piety without positive character,
whereas later he lost himself
more and more in the arid
formalism of dead dogmas.
What was in his power to
give he has given in pictures
such as the &ldquo;Entry of
Christ into Jerusalem&rdquo; and
the &ldquo;Weeping over the Body
of Christ&rdquo;&mdash;both in the
Marienkirche at Lübeck, in
the &ldquo;Miracle of Roses,&rdquo; in
Santa Maria Degli Angeli
at Assisi, in the &ldquo;Christ on
the Mount of Olives&rdquo; in
the Hospital at Hamburg,
and the &ldquo;Betrothal of
Mary&rdquo; in the Berlin National
Gallery&mdash;pictures which expressed
nothing that would
not have been expressed
better at the end of the
fifteenth century. His &ldquo;Holy
Family with St. John and
the Lamb,&rdquo; of 1825, in the
Munich Pinakothek, is in
composition and type a
complete imitation of the
Florentine Raphael; his &ldquo;Lamentation
of Christ&rdquo; in
the Lübeck Marienkirche is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page136" id="page136"></a>136</span>
reminiscent of Perugino; his &ldquo;Burial&rdquo; would never have existed but
for Raphael&rsquo;s picture in the Borghese Gallery. His sentiment coincided
exactly in devotion and godliness with that of Fra Angelico or of the
old masters of Cologne, and when
he devoted himself to programme-painting
he lost all intelligibility.
In the &ldquo;Triumph of Religion in
the Arts,&rdquo; which he completed in
1846 for the Staedel Institute, and
in which he wished to embody the
favourite ideas of Romanticism, that
art and religion must flow together
in one stream, he has copied the
upper part from the &ldquo;Disputa,&rdquo;
the lower part from the &ldquo;School
of Athens,&rdquo; and worked up both
into a tedious and scholastically
elaborated whole. It is only through
a series of unpretentious sketches
which he prepared for engravings,
lithographs, and woodcuts that his
name has still a certain lustre.
Plates such as the &ldquo;Rest in the
Flight,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Preaching of St.
John,&rdquo; or the series &ldquo;Forty Illustrations to the Gospel,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Passion,&rdquo;
the &ldquo;Seven Sacraments,&rdquo; may be contemplated even to-day, since in
them at least no tastelessness of colour stands in the way. These plates,
too, like his pictures, are less observed than felt&mdash;felt, however, with an
innocence and cheerfulness of heart often quite childlike.</p>

<p>It shows above all much self-understanding that all these masters
in their later years restricted themselves exclusively to design, which
better expressed their character. In compositions and sketches of this
kind, which were only <i>drawn</i>, and were thus untrammelled by the fruitless
struggle with the difficulties of the technique of painting and a complete
lack of the notion of colour, they moved more freely and lightly. In
their frescoes and oil-paintings, partly through insufficient technique, partly
through their all too servile imitation of foreign ideals, they went astray.
As draughtsmen, they had more courage to be themselves, and while in
the completer paintings many a fine trait, many an intimate reflection
of the soul was lost, or through the obduracy of the material did not
attain a right expression, here their spiritual and emotional qualities can
be better valued.</p>

<p>Joseph Führich, one of the most staunchly convinced champions
of these reactionary tendencies, has become, entirely owing to his extensive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page137" id="page137"></a>137</span>
activity as a draughtsman, somewhat more familiar to our modern
knowledge than most of his contemporaries. He had begun as a draughtsman.
As a student of the Prague Academy he was an enthusiast for
Schlegel, Novalis, and Tieck; and even before his journey to Rome he
had etched fifteen plates for Tieck&rsquo;s <i>Genoveva</i>. It was Dürer who
exercised the deciding influence upon his further development. He had
been led to him through Wackenroder, and had copied his &ldquo;Marienleben&rdquo;
in 1821. &ldquo;Here I saw,&rdquo; he says in his Autobiography, &ldquo;a form before
me which stood in trenchant opposition to that of the Classicists, who
are anxious to palm off as beauty their smoothness and pomposity
borrowed from the misunderstood antique, and their affected delicacy as
grace. In contrast with that absence of character which prevailing
academic art mistakes for beauty I saw here a keen and mighty
characterisation which dominated the figures through and through, making
them, as it were, into old acquaintances.&rdquo; The strong and godly German
middle age took then in Führich&rsquo;s heart the same place which the
Italian Quattrocento had filled in Overbeck&rsquo;s range of thought. And
this old-German tendency was only temporarily interrupted by his
sojourn in Rome. After he came to Rome in 1826 he became a
Nazarene, and was accustomed there to look back at the tendencies of
his youth as an error; and both at Prague, where he returned in 1829,
after collaborating at the frescoes in the Villa Massini, and at Vienna,
where from 1841 he held the post of professor in the Academy, he found
rich opportunity for putting into practice his ecclesiastical and orthodox
views of art.</p>

<p>His frescoes in the Johannis-und-Altleschenfelder Church in Vienna are,
perhaps, more harmonious in colour, but no more independent in form,
than the works of the others. In his old age he returned once more to the
impressions of his youth, and so found himself again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page138" id="page138"></a>138</span></p>

<p>As a boy, in his little native village of Kratzau, in Bohemia, he had
tended the cows in summer time and had acquired a certain sincere
knowledge of nature and shepherd-life. He had to thank Dürer for his
preference for the idyllic and patriarchal family scenes in Sacred History,
and these tendencies found pleasing expression in pictures like &ldquo;Jacob
and Rachel,&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Passage of Mary across the Mountains.&rdquo; No
matter that the figures in &ldquo;Jacob and Rachel&rdquo; are taken out of the
early pictures of Pinturicchio and Raphael, they are still interwoven,
with their background of landscape, into an idyll of great naïveté and
charm. More especially, however, did the qualities which he owed to
Dürer acquire value&mdash;a sturdy characterisation, a naïve art in telling the
story, and a great wealth of fresh traits, straight from nature&mdash;in the
serial compositions of his old age. There is no sentimental vagueness,
nothing academical. Führich had a keen eye for what was intimate,
familiar; a tender sense of the individualities of landscape in woodland
and meadow, of the charm of everyday life as well as of the animal
world; and though an idealist, he knew how to assimilate ingeniously
what he had observed with a certain realistic fulness. The old story
of Boaz and Ruth grew beneath his hands into a delicious idyll of
country life. From the story of the Prodigal Son he has extracted with
sensitiveness the purely human kernel, and as late as the winter of
1870-71, at the age of seventy-one, he illustrated the legend of St.
Gwendolen, in which he depicted with tender reverence the escape of a
human soul, withdrawn from the world and resigned to God&rsquo;s will, into
Nature and her peace.</p>

<p>Edward Steinle, who went from Rome to Vienna in 1833, and settled in
Frankfort in 1838, is called, not very appropriately, by his biographer,
Constantine Wuzbach, &ldquo;a Madonna painter of our time.&rdquo; His name
deserves to come down to posterity rather for what he created
outside the essential characteristics of his art. In his frescoes in the
minster at Aachen, in the choir of the cathedrals of Strasburg and
Cologne, he stood firm on the standpoint of the Nazarenes; which is as
much as to say they contained nothing novel in the history of art. In
his fairy pictures, however, imagination broke through the narrow confines
of dogma, and entwined itself in creative enjoyment round the vague
figures of fable. His &ldquo;Loreley,&rdquo; in the Schack Gallery, as she looks down,
a Medusa-like destroyer, from the tall cliff; his watchman who looks
dreamily into space over the houses of the old town; his violin player on
his tower who plays, forgetful of the world,&mdash;these have something musical,
poetical, that freshness of sentiment and unsought naïveté which as an
inheritance of his Viennese home was also peculiar in such a high degree
to Schwind.</p>

<p>The Romantic aspiration is revealed in Steinle, even, in a certain &ldquo;yearning
after colour.&rdquo; There lives in his works a refined feeling for colour that, especially
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page139" id="page139"></a>139</span>
in his water-colours, rarely forsakes him. Take, for instance, the fresh,
tinted pen-drawings, engraved by Schaffer, in which he displayed with the
naïveté of Memlinc the life of St. Euphrosyne; the five aquarelles of
Grimm&rsquo;s &ldquo;Snow-White and Rose-Red&rdquo;; or his illustrations to Brentano&rsquo;s
poems, such as the <i>Chronicle of the Wandering Student</i>, and the <i>Fairy Tale of
the Rhine and Radlauf the Miller</i>, in which he developed a delight in
the world and an idea of landscape that in the ascetic Nazarene excite
astonishment.</p>

<p>Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld went, after the completion of the
Ariosto Room of the Villa Massini, first to Vienna, then in 1827 to
Munich, in order to paint the <i>Nibelungen</i> in the halls of the royal
residence of that time, and in the imperial halls of the state
palace the history of Charlemagne, Frederick Barbarossa, and Rudolf
of Hapsburg. He also, however, created his best work at the close
of his life in Dresden,&mdash;the forcible woodcuts of his <i>Picture
Bible</i>, which narrated the world&rsquo;s sacred history in strong and vigorous
strokes.</p>

<p>Strangest to the present-day taste have become the drawings of Cornelius.
His plates to Goethe&rsquo;s <i>Faust</i> have, indeed, a certain austere strength of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page140" id="page140"></a>140</span>
conception, which he learnt from Dürer; but also faults of drawing,
exaggerations, crudities, and errors in perspective, which he did not find
in Dürer.</p>

<p>In his second work, the Nibelungen cycle, an intentional old-German
angularity, with an unintentional modern clumsiness, has effected a <i>mésalliance</i>
even less attractive.</p>

<p class="center chap2">THE ART OF MUNICH UNDER KING LUDWIG I</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">More</span> than seventeen hundred years ago there reigned a Roman emperor
who loved art passionately. He looked upon it from an intellectual
altitude which few have reached, and he valued it as the monumental
consummation of Græco-Roman culture. Standing upon a plane of intellectual
elevation, himself gifted with artistic intuition, he knew of no higher enjoyment
for a ruler than the cultivation of the architectural and other forms of
art. It was he who opened up to the energy of artists a field such as has
never been offered to them before or since. He spent upon his works sums
incalculable, so that his people grew restless under their emperor&rsquo;s mania for
building. His villa at Tivoli, which attained to the extent of a town, was in
itself a copy of everything that he most loved and admired in the world. It
united nearly all the renowned buildings of Athens in one masterly reproduction.
And then with architecture came the other arts. The most
magnificent collections of sculpture were formed, for none had better opportunities
of acquiring the antique masterpieces of the Greek towns. Numberless
frescoes, scenes from those cities and regions which had most impressed him
on his travels, adorned the walls.</p>

<p>And yet subsequent generations have viewed with unconcern this halcyon
period in the history of art. Though his contemporaries fancied that the
splendour of the Greek sun was still radiating over them, it was but a borrowed
lustre, which never went beyond the reproduction or copying of classic examples.
Whatever Greek temples the emperor might build and decorate, he failed to
summon into being a Phidias or a Polygnotes to revive for him the forms of
the antique. The names of the artists who worked for him are forgotten.
They had no originality; they copied the types of the Grecian and Egyptian
periods, and their art was but a repetition of old ideals, without character of
age or place. The fifteen colossal columns of his Olympieion that are still
standing impress one as foreign to Athens, and would seem more in place at
Baalbeck or Palmyra than in this city of the Muses. Epictetus would have
smiled at the emperor diverting himself with an album of the wonders of the
world, as a piece of sentimentality. The age of Hadrian produced thousands
of buildings, statues, and pictures, but no original works.</p>

<p>Will a different judgment be pronounced in the lapse of time upon the
artistic creations of King Ludwig <span class="sc">I</span>? Ludwig also&mdash;his biography reads
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page142" id="page142"></a>142</span>
like that of Hadrian&mdash;was an enthusiastic admirer of art. After the Peace of
Vienna, when the political aspirations of Germany had been frustrated, he
alone among the numerous German princes of the old alliance fostered homeless
art, and thus fulfilled a noble mission. The king&rsquo;s splendid enthusiasm for
the ideal significance of art, which he hoped would lead the German people,
then seeking to work out its individuality, from out of its Philistine narrow-mindedness
to nobler and greater things&mdash;this enthusiasm will redound to his
enduring honour. Schiller&rsquo;s idea of educating humanity by æsthetic means
had in him grown into a living and powerful sentiment.</p>

<p>All that it was possible to accomplish in the cause of art, on the basis of
existing development, his endeavours have fully realised. In the course of
twenty-three years he spent more than £3,000,000 from his privy purse, and
made Munich what it is, the principal art centre of Germany; changed it
from a B&oelig;otia into an Athens; founded its art collections, and erected the
buildings which give the town its character. Then he offered those new walls
to the painter Cornelius, and commanded him to cover them. &ldquo;You are my
field-marshal, do you provide generals of division.&rdquo; In 1814 Cornelius had
written to Bartholdy: &ldquo;The most powerful and unfailing means to restore
German art and bring it into harmony with this great period and the spirit
of the nation would be a revival of fresco-painting as it existed in Italy from
the days of the great Giotto to those of the divine Raphael.&rdquo; And through this
royal command the dream was realised beyond all expectation. No such
lively artistic animation had been witnessed since the great periods of Italian
art; an animation which does not cut the worst figure in German history in
those sad times of political stagnation and reaction. But that there was a
living soul of art in those days posterity will no more acknowledge than it does
in the case of the age of Hadrian.</p>

<p class="noind">sang King Ludwig. Now, after two generations, it can be seen that fresco-painting
at Munich from 1820 to 1840 produced less original conceptions
of the German art of the nineteenth than weak reflections of the Italian art
of the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>Various favourable circumstances combined at that time to cause Cornelius
to be specially looked upon by his contemporaries as an incomparable master.
Since Tiepoli, German monumental art had remained dormant. The frescoes
at Munich were the first attempts made to revive it. And it seemed as though
with Cornelius, German art had at once risen to the dizzy heights to which
Italian art had been led by Michael Angelo. The lookers-on believed in
Buonarotti&rsquo;s resurrection. As in the Sistine &ldquo;Last Judgment,&rdquo; the movement
of his heroic figures appeared plastic and pathetic, and his types, not excepting
the women, gave that impression of the terrible, which none but Signorelli
and Michael Angelo had attained before him. His advent, it was said, might
almost make one believe in a kind of metempsychosis; as though the spirit of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page143" id="page143"></a>143</span>
the great Florentine master, that giant of the Renaissance, had been restored
to humanity. At that very period the Italian art of the Cinquecento enjoyed
the exclusive favour of the German scholars. It alone was worthy of imitation;
in it the æsthetic philosophers
sought for rules and laws to govern
the development of art. And as
they thought that all the qualities
of this artistic method were to be
found in the works of Cornelius, it
was only logical to arrive at the
conclusion which the Crown Prince
Ludwig summed up in the following
words: &ldquo;There has been no painter
like Cornelius since the Cinquecento.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the same time the intellectual
character of his work harmonised
with the wishes of a period in which
the leaders of German thought
tried to forget the dreary dulness
of life by plunging into the most
profound speculations. &ldquo;What
does it matter,&rdquo; writes Hallman,
&ldquo;if we lack all joyous, independent
national feeling? What though we
do not even try to resuscitate this feeling with wars and battles? We
strive after something higher! The world is beginning to respect German
intellect and learning. We believe that in this we are in advance of other
nations, and we seek a mode of expression, we want to give a form to that
lofty thought through our art, in order that we may bequeath to posterity
an image of our fortunate condition.... Therefore it is a remarkable sign
of the times that painting strives to make the weighty output of intellectual
thought a common treasure of all who are neither able nor disposed to
follow speculation to its dizzy heights, nor erudition to its lowest depths;
that painters try to transform the results of those investigations into fresh
and ever lively conceptions&mdash;the element of art.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To accomplish this none was better fitted than Cornelius. What a weight
of thought and learning his works display!</p>

<p>In the Pinakothek, Cornelius&rsquo; main idea was to paint the life and work
of Nature as illuminated by the figures of the Greek gods. For the series of
paintings in the Hall of the Gods, Hesiod&rsquo;s <i>Theogony</i> offered a basis upon which
to demonstrate the idea of the triumph of the creative mind in heaven and
upon earth. In the second room, human passion, power, and tyranny were
illustrated in scenes of Greek heroic life from the <i>Iliad</i>. The frescoes in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id="page144"></a>144</span>
Ludwigskirche were to follow the Christian apocalypse as a concatenation, and
to depict it in symbolic treatment from the Creation to the Last Judgment.
The frescoes for the Campo Santo at Berlin were meant to represent &ldquo;the
universal and most exalted fortunes of humanity, the manifestation of divine
grace towards the sins of mankind, the redemption from sin, perdition, and
death, the triumph of life and eternity.&rdquo; Each of these paintings is a treatise.
Each fresco bears a definite relation to the other; deep philosophic speculations
weave their threads from one to the other. Or else the painter revels
in a suite of compositions which trace a network of intellectual combinations
from one picture to the other. As he himself expressed it, he delivered his
diploma lecture through his paintings.</p>

<p>And this painted erudition harmonised with the requirements of those
times of dominating intellectual tendencies. The scholars saw in Cornelius
the poet, the doctor-in-philosophy; held that the principal value of the work
of art lay in its intellectual contents, and felt that their loftiest mission was
to express these contents still more correctly than the painter himself. The
idea, they said, was the alpha and omega of the painter&rsquo;s art, and must be
accepted at its full value, even when represented in the most shadowy external
form.</p>

<p>These opinions have now vanished entirely. A more extended intercourse
with the old masters and with the art of other countries has gradually
cured the Germans too of that mental hypertrophy from which they
suffered in their view of art&mdash;a complaint whose characteristic symptom was
the entire lack of sensuousness, of that sensibility to beauty of form and
external charm which always has been and always must be the predominating
mood of a society in which art is to flourish. They have gradually reached
the point at which one interests one&rsquo;s self in a picture for the sake of the painting
of it, looks first at the picture, and only then asks what the painter&rsquo;s idea
may have been, or what the spectator is to gather from it. No poem will
find favour which offers acceptable thoughts in badly worded, halting, unmelodious
verse; nor do the loftiest thoughts in themselves suffice to make
a work of art. Profundity of thought is a thing that has little to do with pure
art; and the subject alone, however world-stirring the ideas in it may be, never
makes a thing artistic. We have learnt to find the most intense enjoyment in
the mere contemplation of Titian&rsquo;s &ldquo;Earthly and Heavenly Love,&rdquo; although
we may not yet know what this picture is really meant to convey. And
we know none the less that what renders Raphael&rsquo;s &ldquo;School of Athens&rdquo;
immortal is not its catalogue of ideas, which has been drawn up by an anonymous
pedant, but the master&rsquo;s artistic power, the intensity with which he
expresses what was barely showing bud in the material, the self-reliant
strength and sureness with which the form and colour have succeeded in
outlining and creating every figure and every movement in the picture.</p>

<p>No less has the comparative study of art gradually refined people&rsquo;s sensibility
to originality. We are no longer compelled to place an artist on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page145" id="page145"></a>145</span>
same level with a master of ancient art because of the outer resemblance of
their work. We have progressed so far as to respect in art none but original
genius, and to look upon imitation as a <i>testimonium paupertatis</i> though Praxiteles
or Michael Angelo be the model. In this we find the explanation of the low
esteem in which some of the old masters are now held. The contemporaries
of Mabuse and Marten Heemskerk thought that in these painters they had
found again the great primeval, Titanic nature of Michael Angelo, his vast
motives and majestic forms. To-day we say of them, and with justice, that
they produced nothing better than caricatures of Michael Angelo, that they
expressed themselves in shallow phrases, that their religious pictures are cold
and inflated, and that their mythological presentations with naked figures
impress us as bombastic and repellent. Houbraken, in his biography of
Gérard de Lairesse, wrote: &ldquo;A whole book could be filled with the description
of his innumerable pictures and panels, ceilings and frescoes.&rdquo; To-day we
dismiss this unattractive mannerist in a few lines. What his contemporaries
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page146" id="page146"></a>146</span>
described as his Michaelangelesque and majestic fierceness appears to us,
looking back, as a mere pale imitation.</p>

<p>Measure Cornelius by the same rule, and the result is no less melancholy.
Merciless history paused for a moment to consider whether it ever saw his
equal, and then passed on to the order of the day, as it did with his predecessors.
To us he is no longer the original genius that he was to his contemporaries,
but an imitator. The retrospective history of art marks a new epoch with
him, Heinrich Hess, and Schnorr: the advance from the paths of the early
Italians, trodden by the Nazarenes, to this link with the golden age of the
Cinquecento. The works of Cornelius are mighty shadows cast into our
days by the gigantic figures of Michael Angelo. But only shadows! There
is no blood in them. A direct line leads from Michael Angelo to Millet;
but I doubt whether the master would delight in Cornelius, who has only
used him as a <i>gradus ad Parnassum</i>. The works of Cornelius are the products
of a civilised yet artistically poor period. The idealism of Michael Angelo
had raised itself upon the naturalistic shoulders of Donatello and Ghirlandaio;
this new Cornelian idealism sprang into being full-grown from reminiscences,
and was therefore from the outset without backbone. It is the fruit of
a decadence, not the mature product of a full-blown art, which has taken
centuries to grow and ripen. In Michael Angelo the aspirations of Italian
art, from Giotto onward, attained their zenith. Cornelius, standing solitary
in an inartistic period that had lost every tradition and all technical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page147" id="page147"></a>147</span>
method, believed in the possibility of rising to the same level by making the
forms borrowed from Michael Angelo convey scraps of modern knowledge. In
doing this he could not but confirm the experience, thus described by Goethe
in his <i>Theory of Colour</i>: &ldquo;Even the most perfect models are delusive, by causing
us to pass over necessary decrees of culture, and thus generally carrying us
beyond the goal into a domain of boundless error.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the same time that Heinrich Hess was carrying on his calligraphic exercises
after Raphael and Andrea del Sarto in the Basilika at Munich, Cornelius
was making his schoolboy sketches after Michael Angelo. What is great in his
master is empty <i>pose</i> in him; what is <i>furia</i> in the former is a laboured imitation
in the latter. While the terrific Florentine Master found within himself
the expression of his superhuman figures, his learned follower copies attitudes,
gestures, groups&mdash;familiar to anyone who has been to Italy and passed a few
hours in the Sistine Chapel. One seems to hear the old Florentine&rsquo;s great
voice toned down through the telephone, and irritating us with false pathos
at moments when pathos is quite superfluous. All the faces are distorted
with grimaces, heads of hair are puffed up as though with serpents, garments
fly about; people shout instead of speaking, open their mouths wide as though
they were giving the word of command to an army, stretch out their arms
as though they would embrace the world. A mother bearing a child in her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page148" id="page148"></a>148</span>
arms squeezes it to death. A cook roasting a leg of mutton bastes it with
a Herculean gesture, and a butler emptying a leather bottle has the air of a
river-god meditating a flood. In order that his human beings may look
vigorous and heroic, he makes them walk in seven-league boots, dislocate
their limbs, expand the gigantic measurement of the body far beyond the
human. Every head shows a different colouring: one red as sealing-wax,
another rose-pink, a third <i>caput mortuum</i>. Added to this, the academic
drapery arrangements, those florid garments with their rolling, writhing
folds, for which there is no real justification, and which have no use but that
of ornament. &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; says Goethe, in one of his letters, &ldquo;how true it is that
nothing is remarkable but what is natural: nothing grand but what is natural:
nothing beautiful, nothing, etc., etc., but what is natural.&rdquo; Michael Angelo
is not at all easy to understand; and Cornelius&rsquo; study of him resulted in the
very same mannerism into which the Dutchmen had fallen three hundred
years earlier,&mdash;the only difference being that he surpassed them in erudition.
But although this quality would no doubt have greatly helped him had he
written books, we cannot take it into account in discussing his artistic merits,
any more than we can judge Gérard de Lairesse by his literary achievements.
Nay, more, as he had elected to confine himself to painting, his erudition became
a curse to him, bringing him to disregard beauty of form in a manner as yet
unknown in the history of art. Not only was he filled with ardour for the
loftier thoughts, without allowing any other forms for their presentation but
those which were mere reminiscences of former art periods&mdash;he did not even
give himself leisure thoroughly to assimilate the forms borrowed from Michael
Angelo, and to animate them with fresh life. Hence the fact that, as an
artist, he remains greatly below the level of the Dutch copyists, in whose work
there is at least no faulty drawing and tasteless colouring to be found. He
asked for walls, not as panels to paint on, but as tablets on which to inscribe
his thoughts; felt exclusively as a poet, a man of learning, brooding ideas.
Engrossed in developing these ideas, he valued form and colour no more
than an author would the embellishing of his manuscript with flowing
letters and an artistic arrangement of inks. It is only by this means that
we can explain the unjustifiable carelessness with which he surrendered his
cartoons to his pupils, and allowed them a free hand in the carrying them out, or
account for the evanescent colouring in the Glyptothek and in the Ludwigskirche,&mdash;a
colouring which was even at that time far below the general level,
and which could only be excused in the case of a self-trained and quite untutored
school.</p>

<p>A man of this kind, who had nothing to teach that was worth the learning,
and who excelled only in intellectual qualities which could not be imparted
to others, must needs prove the most dangerous academy-principal Germany
has had since she first boasted an academy. So much the more as his pupils
readily submitted to the personal fascination of this earnest little man with
his black clothes, his pompous appearance, his flashing eagle eye, which made
one believe that, Dante-like, he had looked upon heaven and hell. &ldquo;As there
are men born to command an army, so Cornelius was born to be the head
of a school of painting,&rdquo; said King Ludwig. We can scarcely help smiling
at Schwind&rsquo;s account of
the trembling awe with
which, upon his arrival
from Vienna, he presented
himself to the master.
The red-haired stripling,
in his outgrown clothes,
timidly strolling round the
rooms of the Glyptothek
suddenly sees Cornelius
himself, high on a scaffolding,
in all his glory, in an
effulgence such as surrounds
the head of Ph&oelig;bus
Apollo. Accustomed to
seeing young artists stoop
before him, now stammering,
now paling, now
blushing, the demi-god
descends to the level
of the unknown mortal.
&ldquo;He is quite a little man,
in a blue shirt, with a red
belt. He looks very stern
and distinguished, and his
black, gleaming eyes impress you. He descended from his throne, changed
his blue smock for an elegant frockcoat, drank a glass of water with an easy
manner, and made my flesh thrill with a short explanation of what had been
painted and what was still to be done, tucked a few writing books under his
arm, and went upon his business to the academy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The reformation of the academy, instigated by him at Munich, demonstrated
the one-sidedness of his point of view. He turned it into a school
for fresco-painting. &ldquo;A professorship in <i>genre</i> and landscape painting
appears to me superfluous,&rdquo; he wrote to the king in 1825; &ldquo;true art knows
no subdivision.&rdquo; But as he himself had only partially mastered fresco
painting, he did not even succeed in establishing a school of fresco painters.
It was only one of designers of cartoons.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Read the great poets: Homer, Shakespeare, Goethe; do not forget to
include the Bible. The brush has become the ruin of our art. It has led
from Nature to Mannerism.&rdquo; By means of this teaching Cornelius infused
all his own defects into his academy, which for that reason was doomed from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page152" id="page152"></a>152</span>
the outset to an early decease. A war of extermination, often leading to the
most burlesque scenes, was declared by the Cornelians against the Langerians,
who were despised because they had retained a few of the technical acquirements
of the peruke period. When Cornelius&rsquo;s attention was drawn to the
fact that in one of his cartoons he had given a Greek hero six fingers he
answered with indifference: &ldquo;Ay, and if he had had seven, how would it
affect the general idea?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was only natural, therefore, that his pupils should feel above using a
model. It is said that at the time when they were turning Munich into an
Athens, and the painters were covering the city walls with frescoes, Munich
possessed but one model, and the poor fellow died of starvation. And then,
how they hated colours! They were so difficult to manage! Who, pray,
wanted to learn fresco painting by hard labour, and swallow the chalk-dust?
It was much easier to copy their lord and master, whose name was on their
lips, but not a spark of whose genius was in their heads, with every sort of
mannerism. &ldquo;When nature once produces a new birth she does so with a
lavish hand. Talents, talents enough for centuries!&rdquo; In these words
Cornelius himself did honour to his pupils&mdash;to Carl Herrmann, Strähuber,
Hermann Anschütz, Hiltensperger, and Lindenschmit the elder, the mention
of whose names evokes a painful memory of the arcades in the palace garden
at Munich.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page153" id="page153"></a>153</span></p>

<p>What survives of Cornelius is only the man, the individual. Posterity
will doubtless always honour him for the unflinching energy with which he
upheld his ideal from youth to failing age; for his courage in propounding
and defending what seemed right to <i>him</i>; for refraining from putting on
velvet gloves with the multitude, but frankly showing them his nails. This
high-mindedness of Cornelius, and his lofty conception of the aims of art,
must always command our respect. All his works are the product of a serene,
great, and noble soul. His is a physiognomy with a proud, vigorous profile,
which expresses an intellectual tendency, and can never be forgotten. He
was a man&mdash;as a painter, a curse to German art, but a self-conscious, aristocratic
mind. As he himself said: &ldquo;Art has its high-priests and also its hedge-priests&rdquo;;
and when at the end of his life he made his profession: &ldquo;Never,
under any circumstance of my life, have I lost my pious reverence for the
divinity of art; never have I sinned against it,&rdquo; we none of us refuse to accept
his word.</p>

<table class="flt" style="float: right; width: 460px;" summary="Illustration">

<tr><td class="captionx">KAULBACH.&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;PRINCE ARTHUR AND HUBERT.</td></tr></table>

<p>This unfailing earnestness which suffuses Cornelius&rsquo;s work raises
him high above <i>Wilhelm Kaulbach</i>, and secures for him lasting
fame, when that of Kaulbach shall have been buried with the last
of the &ldquo;cultured&rdquo; patrons for whom he worked, and by whom he was
placed on a pedestal. Look at both of them from a purely artistic
point of view, comparing
them with the old masters,
and both of them sink
equally into insignificance.
But if we come to accept
the problem of art criticism
as a matter of psychology
rather than of æsthetics, if
we search for the relations
between the work of art and
the soul of its author, we
cannot but look upon Kaulbach
as by far the inferior.
Cornelius endeavoured to
raise the masses to his level,
paid for his idealism with
unpopularity, and was never
understood. Kaulbach, the
humble servant of the public,
changed the Spartan iron of
the art of Cornelius for
the base coin of the art
unions; to tickle the multitude,
he clothed voluptuous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page154" id="page154"></a>154</span>
sensuality in the stately garment of the earnest Muse, and was hailed with
jubilation throughout his life. But the valise with which alone, according to
the fairy-tale, one can enter upon the journey to immortality, was still lighter
in his case. Idealistic painting, as professed by Cornelius, had skimmed all
the cream from religious and mythological subjects; so Kaulbach tried to give
something more actual in its stead. He found this in the philosophy of history,
in the images of epochs in the history of the world which were then so much
in vogue, and handed his public, eager for knowledge, a printed programme
upon which he had catalogued the gigantic thoughts and even weightier
references which the picture was said to contain. As the masses were awed
by the severity of the Cornelian conception of forms, he softened it down
with superficial calligraphic elegance: what was sturdy and angular in the
former was by him changed into a coquettish effeminacy. This he effected
by daubing his pictures, which were in no way colour conceptions, with insipid
combinations of colour, and replaced with oleographs Cornelius&rsquo;s illuminated
monumental woodcuts. By these concessions to the picturesque he drove
the axe into the tree which the designers of cartoons had planted. The part
he plays is that of a man of compromise between Cornelius and Piloty; his
frescoes are too sugary; his oil-paintings too faulty. It was he who buried
the era of cartoons, although the obsequies were conducted with all pomp.</p>

<p>A spiritual battle, an aerial battle, the &ldquo;Battle of the Huns,&rdquo; is the first
of his works. Beneath, a real historical event; above, the same reproduced
in the spiritual world. The battle is over; the field is hidden beneath the
corpses of the slain; but the spirits continue the combat in mid-air, and strive
to turn the occasion to account for a display of nudity. Next came the
&ldquo;Destruction of Jerusalem,&rdquo; crammed with ingenious references, and elucidated
with long, printed commentaries. This programme-painting played
its trump card on the staircase of the Berlin Museum, where a space of 240 feet
by 28 feet is occupied by &ldquo;the intellectual manifestations of the historical
<i>Weltgeist</i>&rdquo;; &ldquo;the total evolution of culture with every people of every period
in its principal historical phases&rdquo;; those incidents &ldquo;which, in the evolution
of universal history, mark the important knots with which the closely entwined
threads of the national dramas of the universe are bound together.&rdquo;
The &ldquo;Battle of the Huns,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Destruction of Jerusalem,&rdquo; were included
in the series; and to them were added the &ldquo;Tower of Babel,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Rise of
Greece,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Crusades,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Reformation.&rdquo; The whole of Hegel&rsquo;s
philosophy was reproduced on the walls. But as the pictures are not new
through any novelty or greatness of their conception, we need certainly not
enter into the &ldquo;astounding profundity&rdquo; of their philosophy. The eye is
struck with mere compositions, built up according to certain formulas, and
<i>tableaux vivants</i>, put together with more or less cleverness, theatrical in effect
and crude in colour.</p>

<p>Of his other large pictures, the &ldquo;Naval Battle at Salamis&rdquo; caused a special
stir through its sinking harem. In his &ldquo;Nero&rdquo; he contrasted the orgies of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page155" id="page155"></a>155</span>
the Romans of the decadence with the enthusiasm for death of the early Christians.
Again, in his great cartoon in charcoal of &ldquo;Peter Arbue,&rdquo; he inflated
to monumental dimensions a drawing suitable for a comic paper.</p>

<p>Kaulbach is not an artist to be taken seriously. Woltmann, who made
the same observation twenty years ago, tried at least to vindicate the illustrator,
and expressed his regret that a man who had the stuff in him of a German
Hogarth should unfortunately have been caught in the toils of the Cornelian
school. But this comparison does little justice to Hogarth. There is nothing
in the illustrations of Kaulbach which many other artists could not have
improved upon. In his &ldquo;Reynard the Fox&rdquo; he adapted, for the benefit of
the German public, Grandville&rsquo;s <i>Scènes de la Vie privée et publique des Animaux</i>,
published in 1842. His illustrations for <i>éditions de luxe</i> (&ldquo;The Women of
Goethe,&rdquo; etc.) marked the first steps of the road which ended in Thuman.
And Thuman stands higher than Kaulbach. The faint, unaccented drawing,
the oval &ldquo;beauty&rdquo; of heads, declamatory and expressionless, the academic
touch are common to both of them. But only with Kaulbach do we find the
penetrating perfume of the demi-monde, the voluptuous, satirical laughter
which is not even stilled before Goethe, the pandering sensuality which cannot
touch the purest and tenderest figures in German poetry without using them
as a pretext to fling nudities to the public like bones to a dog. In his &ldquo;Dance
of Death&rdquo; suite, Kaulbach turned into frivolity what Rethel had before expressed
solemnly and earnestly. Like the two augurs, who could not meet
without laughing, so at last the satirical designer began to laugh at his own
monumental pictures. After completing in his series of mural paintings at
the Berlin Museum his &ldquo;Apotheosis of the Evolution of Human Culture,&rdquo;
he explained in his friezes that the whole was, after all, nothing but a dustbin
and a lumber-room. When he was commissioned to depict a suite of paintings
for the upper walls of the new Pinakothek at Munich, the artistic life of that
town, as glorified by King Ludwig&mdash;a suite which the weather has since been
kind enough to render almost invisible&mdash;he fulfilled his task by mocking at
what he should have glorified.</p>

<p>This is the commentary written by Kaulbach himself; and Théophile
Gautier called the suite <i>un carnaval au soleil</i>. &ldquo;The king in his youth spent
millions in order to elevate art,&rdquo; says Schwind; &ldquo;and now in his old age he
pays another thousand pounds in order to be laughed at for it.&rdquo; Heine&rsquo;s
loud, scornful laughter resounds over the grave of romantic literature; and
so the &ldquo;monumental period of German art&rdquo; ends in self-derision.</p>

<p>Moreover, as the mural paintings of the new Pinakothek, like the frescoes
in the Arcades and most of the other monumental products of the period,
are falling into ruin, and only show traces of their past beauty in a few
faint spots of colour not yet entirely effaced, it is quite clear that it was an
inherent fallacy of Cornelius to expect a <i>renovation</i> of national German art
from fresco painting. The Venetians of the sixteenth century well knew
why they did not take up fresco painting. Monumental painting, as aimed
at by Cornelius, must remain an imported plant that cannot possibly thrive
in a northern climate; and oil-painting, since the Van Eycks the medium
and basis of art-culture among the Teutonic races, took its revenge upon his
one-sidedness and his Michaelangelesque disdain, in the fact that at Munich
it had to be learnt again right from the beginning.</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">On</span> the Rhine there existed a school of painting instead of a school of
drawing, a fact which at that time placed Düsseldorf next in importance
to Munich. Wilhelm Schadow, its first director, was lacking in any
personal distinction as an artist, but he had received from his great father
a tendency towards perfection of technique, which brought him and his
school into direct opposition with the purely philosophical painters of the
severe Cornelian tradition, and which has even in our days been able to
exercise an authoritative influence. In Rome he was the only one of the
Nazarenes amenable to the French influence, while the others nervously
held aloof from the members of the French Academy. And this formal bent
of his talent later gave him the qualifications of a sound teacher. Immediately
upon his arrival at Düsseldorf, in November 1826, he was escorted by a stately
throng of students: Carl Friedrich Lessing, Julius Hübner, Theodor Hildebrandt,
Carl Sohn, H. Mücke, and Christian Koehler, who were afterwards
joined by Eduard Bendemann, Ernest Deger, and others. These became
the mainstay of the celebrated Old Düsseldorf School, which was soon supported
by the jubilant enthusiasm of its contemporaries. At the Berlin
exhibitions the new school of painting passed from one triumph to the other.
Young men fresh from school suddenly made names that were honoured
throughout Germany, by reason of the remarkable manner in which their
works succeeded in expressing the sentimental romanticism of the time.</p>

<p>The Wars of Liberty of 1813, which had caused a gust of joyous enthusiasm
to penetrate even into the peaceful seclusion of the Nazarenes,
were not, like the wars of 1870, the outcome of careful calculation, but the
result of a sudden burst of ardour, and the disillusion had now followed
upon the enthusiasm. In 1810, with the French bayonets gleaming outside
the windows, and the French kettledrums drowning the sound of his voice,
Fichte delivered at the Berlin University his famous speeches which sounded
the réveillé for Germany. At the same time Kleist wrote his <i>Hermannschlacht</i>:
Napoleon was to be treated as Hermann had treated Varus. &ldquo;<i>Was
blasen die Trompeten, Husaren heraus</i>,&rdquo; pealed through the air; the song
of &ldquo;<i>Got, der Eisen wachsen liess</i>&rdquo; rose heavenwards in brazen accords. And
not long after, the same lions who had beaten the Corsican at Leipzig, and
had with Arndt conceived the idea of a great, united fatherland, had once
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page158" id="page158"></a>158</span>
more become the same easy-going people, drinking their beer and smoking
their pipes in their little duodecimo principalities as of old. Those dreary
times, which saw no prospect of relief in their own days, must needs nourish
a devotion to the past. That haughty antiquity, which had been possessed
of the ideal to which the present had not been able to attain, became the
object of a fanatical adoration. Men lost themselves in the old storehouses
of faded German reminiscences, and fled for inspiration to the times of a
consolidated German Empire. This return to the ruins of the past was
a protest against the grey, colourless present. The patriotic frenzy of the
poets of freedom changed into enthusiasm for the vanished glories of mediæval
Germany. They remembered with longing and yearning the days when the
robber-knights ruled town and country from their strongholds. Schenkendorff
sang hymns inspired by the old cathedrals, rummaged with holy horror
among the skeletons of knights and heroes in the chapel, and wrote a poem
in memory of the thousandth anniversary of the death of Charlemagne;
Arndt, the bard of the wars of freedom, violently attacked the &ldquo;industrialism&rdquo;
of the time, declaiming against steam and machinery; Zacharias Werner
composed his poem, &ldquo;<i>Das Feldgeschrei sei: alte Zeit wird neu</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This revival of romanticism opened up a wide field to science and poetry.
The apotheosis of the old imperial times was made manifest amid fairy-like
glamour. Poetry grasped the pilgrim&rsquo;s staff, or rode with beauteous
dames on milk-white palfreys through forest and glade. Enchanted genii,
elves, fairies, and goblins were encountered on the road. Nowhere is there
so sweet a scent of blossoms, so innocent a sound of children&rsquo;s merriment,
as in Tieck&rsquo;s delightful and dainty fairy-tales, or in the works of Clemens
Brentano, those precious stories of Father Rhine, of the water-nymphs and
the crystal castles at the bottom of the green current, pictures full of charming
wilfulness, dreamily winsome, like summer evenings on the Rhine. Uhland
sang, as once had sung the knightly poets with the golden harps&mdash;</p>

<p class="noind">To this day we seem to peep between the weather-beaten castles, standing
on their grey rocks along the Rhine Valley, into the realm of romance as
into an enigma propounded by mountain and dale. Rhine and romance!</p>

<p>No spot in Germany was better fitted to become the cradle of a romantic
art than Düsseldorf, the peaceful town on the legend-haunted banks of the
green river. In the fifteenth century, in addition to the school of Florence,
where flowed a rich current of political and human life, where great buildings,
monuments, and frescoes kept architects and sculptors and painters uniformly
busied, there existed in the remote Umbrian valleys, in the land of miracles
and visions, that school of painting in oils which saw its only eternal ideal
in the deep eyes and soft aspect of the Madonna, and made the visionary
aspirations of the soul, emotions, and sentiment the exclusive subject of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page159" id="page159"></a>159</span>
their pictures. In the same manner, in the nineteenth century, we find in
contrast with the Munich school, with its numerous architectural products,
its massive statuary, and the epic-dramatic fresco painting of Cornelius&mdash;&ldquo;wedding
the German to the Greek, and Faust to Helen&rdquo;&mdash;that lyrico-sentimental
Düsseldorf school of painting which embraced Madonnas and
prophets, knights and robbers, gipsies and monks, water-nymphs and nuns
with the same languishing tenderness. In matter and technique it completes
the art of Cornelius and the Nazarenes; that of the Munich master by its
encouragement of oil-painting; that of the Nazarenes by the stress which it
lays upon the more worldly side of mediæval life, upon chivalry, and in a less
degree upon that other pillar of mediævalism the Church. The Nazarenes
are archæological and ascetic; the Düsseldorf school is insipid in a modern
way, feeble, colourless, and sentimental.</p>

<p>Count Raczynski and Friedrich von Uechtritz have given us interesting
descriptions of life at Düsseldorf at that time, and their story reads like a
chapter of Tacitus&rsquo; <i>Germania</i>. &ldquo;<i>Grand dieu! Bons et affectueux allemands!</i>&rdquo;
exclaimed a Parisian critic of the Count&rsquo;s book in sad emotion,
and held up this virtuous German life, as an example worthy of imitation,
to his compatriots, the decadents of fashionable artistic Paris, fallen into
modern luxury. Undisturbed by the hum of a big city, and without any
communication with its surroundings, the Düsseldorf colony of artists lived
its life of seclusion. The painters saw none but painters. They herded
together in the studios, and the sole recreation in the intervals of their work
was a visit to another studio. The whole of the day was devoted to painting;
when the picture was complete it went to the art union; and the hours of
tediousness were overcome with the assistance of a little intrigue. Hildebrandt
possessed the nucleus of a collection of beetles. Lessing, the hunter,
collected pipes and antlers, and only felt himself at home in the little room
which he occupied with Sohn when it assumed the appearance of a gamekeeper&rsquo;s
cottage. Convinced that politics were the ruin of character, they
allowed no questions of the day to interfere with the calmness of their artistic
life. Few of them ever read a newspaper. In the year of revolution, 1830,
their sole interest in the events around them was concentrated in the fear
that a war might disturb their idyllic life. The end of the day&rsquo;s work saw
them in summer-time bent on a pilgrimage to the Stockkämpchen, to refresh
themselves with a cup of buttermilk, to play at bowls, or to enjoy a race
among the cabbage patches of the garden. In winter they made a point of
meeting at seven o&rsquo;clock every Saturday night at the inn for a literary
reading. Each taking his part they recited the dramas of Tieck, of
Calderon, and Lopez; or Uechtritz read extracts from German history,
the Crusades, the period of the emperors, the riots of the Hussites. Every
Sunday night there met at Schadow&rsquo;s a very distinguished intellectual circle,
consisting of Judge Immermann (the reformer of the stage at Düsseldorf),
Felix Mendelssohn the composer, Kortum, author of the <i>Jobsiade</i>, and Assessor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id="page160"></a>160</span>
von Uechtritz, with their ladies. But the great gala-days were the theatrical
performances which took place twice a week. Under the leadership of
Immermann the theatre had become the place whence the young painters
gathered their liveliest suggestions. Some of them went even so far as to
take part in amateur performances, conducted by Immermann, and given
in Schadow&rsquo;s house, under the auspices of the whole of the distinguished
society. And thus the pictures of this school were not conceived under
the influence of life, but of the theatre. The Düsseldorf artists were youths
whose productions were not rooted in life, but in reading and culture; youths
who always moved in good society, and who had passed through the great
ordeals of life, but only on &ldquo;the boards representing the universe.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Theodor Hildebrandt</i> became the Shakespeare of Düsseldorf. The translation
of the works of the English poet by Schlegel had been published some
time earlier, and Immermann, in Düsseldorf, had been the first to offer Shakespeare
a home on the German stage. The performances of his tragedies were
regarded as red-letter days. During the three years of Immermann&rsquo;s leadership
(1834-37), <i>Hamlet</i>, <i>Macbeth</i>, <i>King John</i>, <i>King Lear</i>, <i>The Merchant of
Venice</i>, <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, <i>Othello</i>, and <i>Julius Cæsar</i> were performed on fifteen
occasions in all.<a name="fa1a" id="fa1a" href="#ft1a"><span class="sp">1</span></a> To give the titles of these plays is at once to characterise
the subject-matter of Hildebrandt&rsquo;s paintings. He very often had a hand in
the staging of the plays, and is said to have shown a remarkable histrionic
talent in the performances at Schadow&rsquo;s. He rarely went to other poets for
his inspiration, as in his &ldquo;Pictures from Faust&rdquo; and his &ldquo;Beware of the
Water Nymph,&rdquo; where he honoured Goethe, and in his &ldquo;Brigands,&rdquo; where he
may have been inspired by one of the many variations on <i>Rinaldo Rinaldini</i>
that flooded the market at the time, or perhaps also by Byron, whose influence
was very marked on the Düsseldorf school.</p>

<p>Goethe&rsquo;s <i>Frauengestalten</i>, more especially the Leonoras, were reproduced
in oils by old father <i>Sohn</i>. <i>Eduard Steinbruck</i> painted Genevièves, Red Riding
Hoods, Elves, and Undines, after Tieck and Fouqué; <i>H. Stilke&rsquo;s</i> &ldquo;Pictures
from the Crusades&rdquo; introduced Walter Scott to the German public. Uhland&rsquo;s
first ballads had brought into fashion the damsels who from the ramparts of
their castles wave a sad farewell to the lonely shepherds; the ancestral tombs,
in which the last knight of his race takes his everlasting rest; the lists, where
melancholy heroes stab themselves. His <i>Love-song of the Shepherd to the
Shepherdess</i>&mdash;</p>

is due to the publication of Von Rainer&rsquo;s History in 1823, which
took a greater hold of the public than did Schiller&rsquo;s <i>History of the Thirty

<p>Even the idyllic and touching scenes from the Old Testament and the
Hebrew elegies are easily traced back to theatrical inspirations. With the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page162" id="page162"></a>162</span>
exception of the frescoes of the Casa Bartholdy, the subjects of which were
selected with an eye to the religious belief of their purchaser, the Nazarenes
found all the subject-matter they wanted in the New Testament. The
Passion of Our Lord was unable to inspire the Düsseldorf school. As compared
to the few Christian paintings by W. Schadow, and the dreamy Madonnas
of Deger, Ittenbach, and little Perugino Mintrop, we find a far greater number
of scenes from the Old Testament, which at the time gave birth to numerous
dramas. Hübner, always inclined to idyllic and melancholy scenes, painted
Ruth and Boaz, his first great picture, which established his reputation. After
Klingemann had utilised the whole life of Moses by turning it into a theatrically
effective sequence, Christian Koehler scored a success with his &ldquo;Moses
hidden in the Bulrushes&rdquo; and his &ldquo;Finding of Moses,&rdquo; and then, incited by
Raupach&rsquo;s &ldquo;Semiramis,&rdquo; abandoned his biblical heroines for Oriental ones.
Theodor Hildebrandt took Tieck&rsquo;s &ldquo;Judith&rdquo; as an inspiration for his picture
of this Jewish heroine. Kehren&rsquo;s &ldquo;Joseph reveals Himself to his Brethren&rdquo;
was begun after the opera <i>Joseph in Egypt</i> had been performed at Düsseldorf.
Bendemann, in 1832, played his trump card with his &ldquo;Lament of the Jews,&rdquo;
now in the Cologne Museum, after Byron had made his propaganda, suggested
by the sad lives of the children of Israel, and Friedrich von Uechtritz had
caused his drama, <i>The Babylonians in Jerusalem</i>, to be performed, ending as
it does with the sending of the Jews into captivity in Babylon&mdash;</p>

Jews into Captivity in Babylon&rdquo; (1872), in the Berlin National Gallery, were
variations on the same theme.</p>

<p>The productions of the Düsseldorf school were thus in perfect harmony
with the programme issued by Püttmann in his book. Pictorial representations
may be taken from two ranges, History or Poetry; the painter may
choose an historical fact as a subject for representation, or reproduce in visible
form the rhythmically shaped fancy of a stranger. History shows him figures
full of expression, and even a less powerful artist will find it possible to make
a true copy of them. If the painter works from poems his representations
are sure to meet with approval, as they render the beautiful and the attractive
in visible shape. &ldquo;But the greatest success lies in store for those works
which depict in harmony with the mood of the times historical or
poetical performances which express human suffering in its various stages,
from homely and everyday griefs to the silent sorrow of irretrievable
catastrophe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus the scale of sorrow from sad melancholy to painful suffering became
the speciality of the Düsseldorf school. At the foot of the scale we
find the pictures which &ldquo;represent the common, yet keen sorrow of
parents at the death or the sad future of their children.&rdquo; Lessing&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Royal Pair&rdquo; mourn the death of their daughter; Hagar grieves because
she is forced to abandon her son Ishmael in the desert; Genoveva,
because the roe is so long in coming to the rescue. The mortal grief of
love is represented by Lessing&rsquo;s &ldquo;Leonora&rdquo;; grief of love at separation by

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page164" id="page164"></a>164</span>
too early to his monastery, and is plagued by the ticking of his watch. The
Hohenstaufens, of course, appealed more to the pity of the public: the misfortunes
of the beautiful Enzin, of Manfred and Conrad, gave birth to a sentiment
of profoundest sadness. Even brigands mourn at the depravity of the
world. The age had come to despise its own Philistine situation so deeply
that it looked up to the brigands, the adversaries of civil order, as to representatives
of justice. All depravity, it was said, originated with the public
functionaries, and to the noble brigands was allotted the task of revolutionising
existing things. Their ally in this was to be the poacher. At a time when a
revision of the game-laws was the sole timid wish the people ventured to lay
before its princes, it was only logical that the poacher should be looked upon
as the victim of injustice, as the rescuer of the small man from the claws
of feudal despotism. The numerous pictures that glorify him, as he falls
weltering in his blood beneath the guns of the gamekeepers, make pendants to
Raupach&rsquo;s &ldquo;Smugglers,&rdquo; and to the rest of the highly esteemed literature
which turned the life of the poacher into sentimental dramas or novels.</p>

<p>Fortunately we, in our days, find great difficulty in entering into the
spirit which gave birth to these productions. A world lies between it and
the present, just as between the Germany of to-day and the Germany of
1830. Men of the younger generation, who were still at school when
Bismarck spoke his word of blood and iron, can hardly understand how
this modern, realistic Germany can have been, two generations ago, a sentimental
Germany. Now the significance of the Düsseldorf school in the
history of civilisation lies in the
fact that they are the real
representatives of that age of
sentimentality. A generation
that melted away in tearful
dreamings must needs enthusiastically
recognise its own flesh
and blood in those knights and
damsels, squires and pages,
monks and nuns, who, infinitely
amorous or infinitely religious,
were all infinitely sentimental;
and things that now only evoke
a smile or a shrug must needs
have moved them to tears.
Look where you will, you
meet the same world. It hung
on the walls, it displayed itself
in engravings, lithographs, and
coloured prints; if one lay
down for a siesta, one found a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page165" id="page165"></a>165</span>
lovelorn knight and damsel or a praying nun stitched on the cushion; if
one put one&rsquo;s foot on a carpet, one trod upon noble hunting-dames on horseback,
falcon on wrist; one carried them in one&rsquo;s pockets on cigar-cases and
handkerchiefs; the traveller and the cheap tripper took them abroad on
their knapsacks.</p>

<p>Technically, the pictures of this school were not without their merits.
&ldquo;The greatness of Michael Angelo&rdquo; may not have been Bendemann&rsquo;s, and
Sohn&rsquo;s carnations are far removed from &ldquo;the melting colouring of Titian.&rdquo;
But as opposed to the one-sidedness to which fresco painting at Munich was
given up, the encouragement of oil-painting at Düsseldorf must be looked
upon as praiseworthy. These painters were the first in Germany to try again
to learn how to paint in oils. The extreme artistic clumsiness that had
reigned under Cornelius was followed by a period in which, under Schadow,
earnest studies and serious work were devoted to an effort again to master a
technical medium. Their friendly emulation led to surprising progress, which
assured to the Düsseldorf school a technical superiority over all the other
German schools of the period.</p>

<p>If, nevertheless, their pictures have not maintained their position as vital
works of art, it is due to the fact that they were produced under the
pressure of that mechanical idealism which makes all their productions
so utterly unattractive to us. The ideal &ldquo;line of beauty&rdquo; has turned the
figures into bloodless shadows and washed-out theatrical forms. As philosophy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page166" id="page166"></a>166</span>
was to Cornelius, so to the Düsseldorfers was poetry their Noah&rsquo;s Ark.
The interest aroused by the poet was their ally; the breath of the wind that
set their boat afloat; the general poetical tendency made up for the deficiency
in artistic interest. Had it not been
for the support of the poets, their
sugary, insipid figures would have
from the beginning been unable to
hold their own. For after having been
retouched by &ldquo;Idealism,&rdquo; nothing
vital remained in those romantic
kings, fantastic knights, Jews, and
stage princesses; nothing particular
and characteristic in their generalisation,
nothing generally human.
With them a king is always an heroic
prince in black harness, a woolly
beard, and a scarlet cloak. A queen
is represented as proud and dark, or
tender and fair-haired. In the much-beloved
&ldquo;couples&rdquo; from poems,
characterisation goes no further than general contrasts: the <i>brunette</i> in red
attire with white sleeves; the tender <i>blonde</i> with the complementary garment
of pale violet; the one with luxurious <i>embonpoint</i>, the other languidly slender&mdash;men
brown, women white, youths rosy. Knights wear silvery helmets with
or without plumes; now with open, now with shut visor; sometimes they sit
on poetic palfreys, now of slender, now of sturdy build. The only impressions
they are subject to may be interpreted with the assistance of the plaster bust:
honour, fidelity, love. And as sentiment and heroism are national virtues
of the Germans, they are bound to show sentimental expression whilst killing
their adversaries. Even the brigands are generalised lay figures. The
Düsseldorf ideal of beauty aimed at a certain tender, vaguely graceful swing
of outline that anxiously avoided all manly and strong, energetic and characteristic
expression, all that could remind one of nature. They rejected
Leonardo da Vinci&rsquo;s advice, to tug at the nipple of Mother Nature, but looked
upon her merely as their aunt; and for this, despised Nature took her revenge
by making their figures shapeless and phantom-like. And as their &ldquo;dread
of painted stupidities&rdquo; did not once bring them to make bold mistakes, we
can neither praise nor censure their pictures, cannot enjoy them or take
offence at them, but look at them <i>sine ira et studio</i>, with a lukewarm feeling
of utter indifference.</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">It</span> was reserved for two younger men to reach the aim that hovered in the
far distance before Cornelius and the Düsseldorfians. And, by one of
fortune&rsquo;s remarkable freaks, the greatest German monumental painter of the
nineteenth century came from the Düsseldorf, the greatest Romanticist from
the Munich school.</p>

<p><i>Alfred Rethel</i> was twenty-four years old when he received the commission
to paint the frescoes in the <i>Kaisersaal</i> at Aachen, and had previously worked
in the Düsseldorf Academy, and then with Veit at Frankfort. But the
pictures are suggestive neither of his Düsseldorfian nor of his Nazarene
training. The deeds of Charlemagne, the ancestor of the German Imperial
dynasties, are nobly, and, at the same time, vigorously embodied in them.
Rethel had studied the harsh strength of his Albrecht Dürer, but only as a
kindred spirit studies his kin. Neither Cornelius nor Schnorr has depicted
the old German heroic might and the vanished imperial grandeur, the great
past, the iron Middle Ages, with such notable traits. How plain in his heroic
greatness stands the mighty conqueror of the Saxons by the overthrown pagan
idols; how simply and majestically does he march into conquered Pavia.
What an inexorable and irresistible warrior he seems, as he rages amongst the
Moors who flock round the cars of their idols; and with what grave phantom
dignity does he gaze in death upon the young Emperor Otto, who has forced
his way into his vault, and kneels trembling before the lifeless frame of his
great forefather. There is no vestige of pose, nothing superfluous; everywhere
simplicity, compression, lucidity. Only what is necessary is inscribed
here, in the lapidary style. No meaningless phrase interrupts his narrative;
the inner meaning is never sacrificed to any external beauty of line; his forms
like his thoughts are severe and precise. He draws with a sure hand in crisp
lines, like a writer who aims at the utmost brevity and so lays especial emphasis
on his sentences and words. The self-revelation in these pictures is admirable&mdash;the
illuminating clearness with which they tell what they have to say
without the aid of any commentator, the directness with which they present
in an artistic aspect the substance to be given. And with this substance the
painting corresponds.</p>

<p>It is to be deplored that Rethel himself could carry out in colour only four
of his designs, and that the completion of the rest was entrusted to the painter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page168" id="page168"></a>168</span>
Kehren, who spoilt by his effort after charm of colour the collective impression
of the series. The pictures painted by Rethel himself are, in the simplicity
of their colouring, in remarkable accordance with the powerful style of
his drawing. Rethel&rsquo;s <i>painting</i> has something stern and grey, bare and
sombre. He belongs to the stylists whose implement is rather charcoal than
the brush; but he had, although no colourist, a free command of colour,
and never committed any fault of taste, but with a remarkably sure instinct
used colour in the mass, simply, but yet with significant effect. He might
have been the man to create a monumental German art. A tragic destiny!
Heinrich von Kleist, the greatest German poet of the post-classical age, who was
chosen for so high a vocation, the creation of a new dramatic style, shot himself;
and the giant, Alfred Rethel, was to end in madness. Barely forty years
old was he when he walked by the warder&rsquo;s side in the courtyard at Düsseldorf,
picking up flint-stones, a poor, simple madman. Only two series of designs
ensure, apart from the frescoes at Aix, the immortality of his name: &ldquo;Hannibal&rsquo;s
Passage over the Alps,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Dance of Death.&rdquo; As a draughtsman,
just as a painter of frescoes, he is the same Titan, sounds the same stern,
manly note.</p>

<p>Here the heroic hosts of the Carthaginians stand anxious, yet resolved, at
the foot of the grim Alpine pass; steep, beetling cliffs, precipice, ice and
snow, tower before them. Now the climb begins, and the struggle with the
fierce, barbaric folk of the mountains, who swing themselves on leaping-pole
like wild animals over the gaping crevices in the ice. Yonder are men, horses,
an elephant, hurled into the abyss; some have spitted themselves on jagged
branches of trees in their fall, others twine themselves together in horrible
coils; at last the most advanced have reached the heights, and the heroic
figure of the commander points out proudly to them, as they breathe once
more, the plains of Italy.</p>

<p>Over his second work there broods the shadow of that mental darkness
which was to surround him. When, in the year 1848, the political storm
burst over the soil of Europe, Rethel&rsquo;s fantasy reaped a rich harvest. He
drew his &ldquo;Dance of Death,&rdquo; represented Death the Leveller, who drives poor
fools behind the barricades. The ghostly and spectral, that horror of death
that breaks in upon us in the midst of life, had been the propensity of German
art since Dürer and Holbein. Like them, Rethel loved the world of the
diabolical, and similarly chose for his embodiment of it the sturdy, simple
contours of the old German wood engravings. Death as the hero of revolution
makes a commencement. There he rides as the town-executioner, a cigar
between his lips, his scythe in his hand. He sits shambling in the saddle,
his smock and tall boots dangle on his bony figure. Dressed like a charlatan,
he excites the people before the tavern against the rulers, that he may earn
his harvest at the barricade. He himself stands firm and proud, like a general
on the field of battle, the flag in his hand, and the bullets of the soldiers whistling
harmlessly through his bony ribs. But the artisans who follow him are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page169" id="page169"></a>169</span>
not invulnerable as he is; the grape-shot sweeps them down off the barricade.
The contest is over; triumphant, with a wreath of bay round his skull, mocking
venom in his glance, Death rides with his banner unfurled across the
barricade, where the dying writhe in their gaunt death-struggle, and children
bewail their fallen fathers. The plate, &ldquo;Death as the Assassin,&rdquo; takes up the
story of the outbreak of cholera at a masked ball in Paris. In terrified haste
the dancers and musicians leave the hall. Only one mummy-like spectre,
the Cholera himself, a shape of horror, keeps his ground, as though turned to
stone, and holds the triumphant scourge like a sceptre in his bony hand.
Death, in a domino, with two bones for a fiddle, plays a call to the dance;
and beneath the awful sounds of his tune the people, stretched on the ground, in
sick convulsions, grinning with distorted features, behind their jesters&rsquo; masks,
twist and turn.</p>

<p>There is something of Th. A. Hofmann&rsquo;s wild fantasy of the ague-fit in
this picture,&mdash;something morbid, satanic, that suggests Félicien Rops; yet,
at the same time, something so pithy and virile, and in form so compressed,
well-balanced, and correct, that it brings the old Germans, too, to our recollection.
And the reconciliation with which the series ends is pathetic. In
the high steeple, lit by the rays of the setting sun, the grey old bellringer, his
worn hands clasped in prayer, has fallen quietly asleep in his armchair. A
calm peace rests upon his good, old, devout countenance. The thin hands,
with their marks and furrows, tell a long tale of hard work, sorrow, and longing
for rest. And the weary veteran has made a pilgrimage for the health
of his poor soul, as prove the pilgrim&rsquo;s hat and staff by the wall; and now
Death has really come, the well-known presence indeed, but this time with
no grin of mockery, rather in profound pity. In his ingenious manner of
giving an expression of mockery, cold indifference, or compassion to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page170" id="page170"></a>170</span>
head of the skeleton, Rethel stands on a level with Holbein. To the old
ringer, Death, who before had grinned so diabolically, is a gentle and trusted
friend. Quietly and pensively he performs the task that the old man has
done so often when he attended the departure of some pilgrim of earth with
the solemn notes of his bell. Rethel himself had still to drag through many
years in an obscure night of the spirit before for him, too, Death, as the friend,
rang the knell.</p>

<p>And now for him who was the most admirable of them all, Lady Adventure&rsquo;s
true knight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master <i>Schwind</i>, you are a genius and a Romanticist.&rdquo; This stereotyped
compliment was paid by King Ludwig to the painter on each occasion that,
without buying anything of him, he visited his studio. And with equal
regularity Schwind, when he had sat down again at his easel, after the royal
visit, to smoke his pipe, is said to have muttered something extremely disloyal.
In this trait the whole Schwind is already revealed,&mdash;free from all
ambition, every inch an artist.</p>

<p>W. H. Riehl has described a series of such episodes, which one must know
in order to understand Schwind, that highly gifted child of nature, who
separates himself from the group of philosophical, &ldquo;meditative&rdquo; artists of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page171" id="page171"></a>171</span>
age, both as an individual and as an audacious, original genius of effervescent
wit.</p>

<p>When an æsthetic once hailed him as &ldquo;the creator of an original, German
kind of ideal, romantic art,&rdquo; Schwind repeated very slowly, weighing each
word: &ldquo;&rsquo;An original, German kind of ideal, romantic art.&rsquo; My dear sir, to
me there are only two kinds of pictures, the sold and the unsold; and to me
the sold are always the best. Those are my entire æsthetics.&rdquo; Or a noble
amateur comes to him with the request that he would take him just for a few
days into his school, and instruct him especially in his masterly art of drawing
in pencil. Whereupon Schwind: &ldquo;It does not require a day for that, my dear
Baron; I can tell you in three minutes how I do it, I can give you all the
desired information at once. Here lies my paper,&mdash;kindly remark it, I buy
it of Bullinger, 6 Residenz Strasse; these are my pencils, A. W. Faber&rsquo;s, I
get them from Andreas Kaut, 10 Kaufinger Strasse; from the same firm I
have this indiarubber too, but I very seldom use it, so that I use this penknife
all the more, to sharpen the pencils; it&rsquo;s from Tresch, 10 Dienersgasse,
and very good value. Now, I have all these things lying together on the table,
and a few thoughts in my head as well; then I sit down here and begin to
draw. And now you know all that I can tell you.&rdquo; Again he asks &ldquo;to be
decorated with an order,&rdquo; because he &ldquo;is ashamed to mix in such a naked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page172" id="page172"></a>172</span>
condition with his bestarred confrères,&rdquo; and after the bestowal of the desired
decoration he says: &ldquo;I wore it only once, at the last New Year&rsquo;s levée, but I
vowed at the same time that six horses should not drag me there again. Before,
there was at any rate a beautiful queen there, and then the court ladies laughed
at one; but amongst men only, the stupidity of it is not to be endured.&rdquo;
When he grumbles over commissions which have been given to others, and
adds good-temperedly, &ldquo;Indeed, I&rsquo;m an envious fellow&rdquo;; when he paints
the most delicate pictures and then growls, &ldquo;What am I to do with the things,
if nobody buys them?&rdquo; when he indulges in outbursts of wrath, and a minute
later has forgotten again the abusive words which the others spitefully bring
up against him years afterwards,&mdash;then here, too, his happy humour forces
its way everywhere, that divine naïveté which forms the soul of his and of all
true art.</p>

<p>Schwind remains a personality by himself&mdash;the last of the Romanticists,
and one of the most amiable manifestations in German art. He was free from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page173" id="page173"></a>173</span>
the malady of that sham Romanticism which sought the salvation of art in
the resurrection of the Middle Ages, misunderstood, and grasped sentimentally,
and as it were by stencil. He was spiritually permeated by that which had
given Romanticism the capacity to exist: the sense of that forgotten and
imperishable world of beauty which it has again discovered. The others
sought for the &ldquo;blue flower,&rdquo; Schwind found it; resuscitated in all its faëry
beauty that &ldquo;fair night of enchantment which holds the mind captive.&rdquo; He
incorporated the romantic idea in painting as Weber did in music, and his works,
like the <i>Freischütz</i>, will live for ever. Many a man listened to him holding
forth upon water-nymphs, gnomes, and tricksy kobolds, as of beings of whose
existence he appeared to have no doubt whatever. On one occasion, while
out walking near Eisenach in the Annathal, a friend laughingly observed to
him that the landscape really looked as if gnomes had made the pathway
and had had their dwellings there. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you believe it was so? <i>I</i> believe
it,&rdquo; answered Schwind in all seriousness. He <i>lived</i> in the world of legend and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page174" id="page174"></a>174</span>
fairy-tale. If ever a fairy stood beside the cradle of a mortal man, assuredly
there was one standing by Schwind&rsquo;s; and all his life long he believed in her
and raved about her. Born in the land where Neidhart of Neuenthal had
sung and the Parson of the Kahlenberg had dwelt, to his eyes Germany was
overshadowed with ancient Teutonic oaks: for him, elves hovered about
watersprings and streams, their white robes trailing behind them through the
dewy grass; a race of gnomes held their habitation on the mountain heights,
and water-nymphs bathed in every pool. In him part of the Middle Ages
came back to life, not in livid, corpse-like pallor, but fanned by the revivifying
breath of the present day.</p>

<p>For that is what is noteworthy about Schwind; he is a Romanticist, yet
at the same time a genuine, modern child of Vienna. There are three things
in each of which Vienna stands supreme: hers are the fairest women, the
sweetest songs, and the most beautiful waltzes. The atmosphere of Vienna
sends forth a soft and sensual breath which encircles us as though with women&rsquo;s
arms; songs and dances slumber in the air, waiting only for a call to be
awakened. Vienna is a place for enjoyment rather than for work, for pensive
dreaming rather than for sober wakefulness of mind. Moritz Schwind was
a child of this city of beautiful women, songs, and dances, as may be observed
in the feminine nature of his art, in its melody and rhythm: in music, indeed,
it had its source. In song-singing, bell-ringing Vienna it was difficult for him
to guess in what direction his talents lay; but all his life long he kept an open
eye for the charms of beautiful womanhood. No artist of that time has
created lovelier forms of women, beings with so great a charm of maidenly
freshness and modest grace. Instead of the goddesses, heroines, and nun-like
female saints, whose appearance dated from the Italy of the Cinquecento,
Schwind depicted modern feminine charm. The group of ladies in &ldquo;Ritter
Kurt&rdquo; is, even to the movement of their gloved fingers, graceful in the modern
sense. He was a painter of love&mdash;a breath of Walter von der Vogelweide&rsquo;s
ideal perfection of womanhood pervades his pictures.</p>

<table class="reg f90" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>&ldquo;Durchsüsset und geblümet sind die reinen Frauen,</p>

<p class="i05">In Lüften, auf Erden, noch in allen grünen Auen.&rdquo;</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p>Schwind, too, painted frescoes, and in them he is very unequal. All his
life long he complained of the lack of important commissions; it was fortunate
for him that he did not get more of them. Such a painter as he can execute
no orders but his own,&mdash;just as good poems do not come to order. A long
list of wall paintings&mdash;the Tieck room and the figure-frieze in the Habsburg
Hall of the new palace at Munich, the frescoes in the Kunsthall and in the Hall
of Assembly of the Upper House at Karlsruhe, those in the Castle of Hohenschwangau,
even the theatre pieces in the loggia and in the foyer of the Vienna
Opera House&mdash;could be easily struck out of Schwind&rsquo;s work, without detriment
to his reputation. Only when the subject permitted him to strike a simple
note of fairy music was he charming even in his wall-paintings, and therefore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page175" id="page175"></a>175</span>
those which depict scenes from the life of St. Elizabeth in the Wartburg are
rightly the most celebrated. Like Rethel in the field of the heroic, so Schwind
in that of romantic legend reached the goal which the former kept before his
eyes, for the revivifying of the time when there was an enthusiasm for fresco
painting. His paintings are poor in colour, motley, magic-lantern views in the
style of the heraldically treated figures seen in the frescoes and stained glass
of the Romanesque and early Gothic Middle Ages, and yet in every line as
delightful as the man himself. Nowhere do we find glaring contrasts, nowhere
any violent agitation in the expression of the faces. It is by the avoidance
of all landscape accessories, and by a hardly noticeable change in the simple
plant-ornamentation in the background, that the events represented are made
to lose touch with actual reality. In the first picture, bright-hued birds flit
here and there among the rose-branches forming the decorative work; in
that which treats of St. Elizabeth&rsquo;s expulsion, the Wartburg rises in the
background, while little singing angels are perched upon the boughs of the
bare winter-stripped trees that overlook the miserable cell in which St. Elizabeth
dies. A touch of the true-heartedness of the ancient Teuton, a breath
of peacefulness, permeates Schwind&rsquo;s Wartburg pictures like the waft of an
angel&rsquo;s wings.</p>

<p>Schwind, like Rethel, is numbered among the few artists of that period
who were able to preserve their absolute simplicity against the great painters
of Italy. &ldquo;I went into the Sistine Chapel,&rdquo; he says of his journey to Rome,
&ldquo;gazed upon Michael Angelo&rsquo;s work, and sauntered back home to work at
my &lsquo;Ritter Kurt.&rsquo; I take the
greatest possible pleasure in my
present picture, although the subject
is absolutely crazy. I love to paint
trees and rocks and old walls, and
I have put plenty of them into it,
besides a fellow on horseback and
in full armour. What does it
matter? <i>One must work according
to one&rsquo;s natural capacity. Even at
the time when I was studying at
Munich I came to the conclusion
that that of which the mind of itself
takes hold, and that which takes hold
of it, is the one only right thing for
every man who has a vocation. Art
consists of this unconscious taking
hold and being taken hold of. Deus
in nobis.</i> And therefore the young
artist will do well to be careful in
visiting the museums. You go
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page176" id="page176"></a>176</span>
to the galleries where the works of the
great masters are to be seen. There
you see, all at once and all together
in confusion, works of every school
and of every era. It is extremely likely
that you are overwhelmed by the
mass, and beauties of every kind,
belonging to tendencies and epochs
altogether diverse, shake the ground
under your budding vocation, and like
fifty various climates influencing a
single plant, arrest a growth which is
possible only in one, and that a
favourable one. <i>The imitation of the
Italians in especial can as a rule have
only the effect of estranging us from our
own individuality</i>, a fact which was
once again fully borne in upon me
when I saw Overbeck&rsquo;s new altar-piece
in the Cathedral of Cologne. It may
sound severe and uncalled-for from
me, but <i>every man who has forgotten
his mother-tongue is tottering on his feet.
The imitation of foreigners is the dangerous
blind alley into which our art has
betaken itself</i>. When I exhibited
&lsquo;Ritter Kurt&rsquo; people said, &lsquo;It is Old
German,&rsquo; and forthwith it stood condemned,
as if that were a disgrace, and as if one should not rather have
saluted the fact with joy, as the right thing for us Germans. The art
of painting which I follow is the German, and glass-painting must be taken
as its foundation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In Schwind one might imagine an old German master of the race of
Albrecht Altdorfer come to life again. In the small, simple pictures of landscape
and fairy-tale, which Count Schack has collected in his private gallery
for the quiet and devout enjoyment of thousands, he has given us his best
work as a painter.</p>

<p>Yet even <i>his</i> pictures have the failings of his time. Compared with Dürer,
he seems like a gifted amateur; there are manifold empty, dead spaces to
be observed among his figures; their action is at times misconceived and
puppet-like; and his sense of colour was always limited. One may be permitted
to look forward to some master, at the head of a coming epoch in
art, who shall combine with Schwind&rsquo;s German fairy imagination the sensuous,
dashing colour-elf that possessed B&oelig;cklin. There might a school of art
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page177" id="page177"></a>177</span>
arise, to follow for the future the
path which Franz Stuck has struck
out. As to technique, Schwind was a
child of the cartoon era; as regards
tenderness of feeling, he is a modern.
It is difficult to persuade a non-German
of Schwind&rsquo;s greatness, in presence of
the <i>pictures</i>; but when they are
reduced to black-and-white they
appeal to every one. The heliogravure
enables one to imagine what
the original does not show; it incites
the soul to further poetic creation, it
announces what Schwind would be
were he alive to-day. An elfland
kingdom of enchantment, full of
genuine poetry and beauty, opens
out before us; a fairy garden, where
the &ldquo;blue flower&rdquo; pours forth the
whole of its sense-benumbing perfume.
Count von Gleichen; the boy&rsquo;s miraculous
horn; the mountain spirit
Rübezahl, wandering along through
the wild mountain forest; the hermits;
the elves&rsquo; dance; the erlking; the
knight and the water nymph,&mdash;they
are flooded with all the enchantment
of Romanticism, they possess deep feeling without mawkishness, the old-German
note of fairy legend and Hans Memlinc&rsquo;s childlike simplicity, yet
at the same time the life of the present day, full of feeling and rich in delicate
shades. How strong and brave are the men; how tender, noble, and
charming the women! What a modest, maidenly art it is! just as its
master was an innocent, harmless, and joyous being.</p>

<p>His works, in comparison with those of his contemporaries, who were
devising systems by means of which art should be brought back to the classical,
bear the stamp of naïve creations in which no hypocrisy, no decorative
nothingness finds expression. As against the erudite treatises of the Cornelius
school, they preached for the first time the doctrine, that in works of art
what is important is not the quantity of learning displayed therein, but the
quality of the feeling exhibited. With all their inequalities, all their incorrectness,
all their weak points, they are inspired, sung, dreamed, and not put
together in cold blood according to recipes: in them is the pulsation of a
human heart, a tender human heart full of delicate feeling. This it is which
constitutes his magical attraction to-day, which makes him the firm bond
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page178" id="page178"></a>178</span>
of connection between the moderns. He was no imitator, no soulless calligraphist
performing laborious school exercises after the manner of the old
masters; he spoke the language of his time.</p>

<p>He was one of the first who at that time laid aside the prejudice against
modern costume, and in his &ldquo;Symphony&rdquo; turned to artistic account, in
one fantastic whole, even Franz Lachner&rsquo;s frockcoat and Fräulein Hetzenecker&rsquo;s
modern society toilette. &ldquo;If you may paint a man hidden in an
iron stove&mdash;what is called a knight in armour&mdash;you may still more permissibly
paint a man in a frockcoat. In general, one can paint what one will,
provided always that one wills what one can.&rdquo; And it was only by means
of this present-day temper that Romanticism could find so full-toned an
expression in his works. Only because he was truly a citizen of the present
day and felt its blood beating in his veins, could he feel the congenial elements
of the past. To him the old-time legends were no antiquarian, erudite,
pedantic lumber; they were a part of himself, and he interpreted them in
more childlike simplicity of manner and with more delicate feeling than
any artist of former times, because he observed them with the eye of the
present age, with an eye made keen with longing. Just as in his &ldquo;Wedding
Journey&rdquo; he raised all reality into the poetry of purest romance, so is his
Romanticism saturated with a sense of reality charged with memories of
home. Out of his fairy-tale pictures is breathed a charming fragrance of
the long-vanished days of earth&rsquo;s first springtide, and yet for that very reason
a breath of the most modern Décadence. He is distinguished from Marées
and Burne-Jones, from Puvis de
Chavannes and Gustave Moreau, by a
very unmodern attribute&mdash;he is bursting
with health. He is still naïvely
childlike, free from that elegiac melancholy,
that temper of weary resignation,
which the end of the nineteenth
century first brought into the world.</p>

<p>Yet Schwind was one of the first to
feel and give expression to that modern
sense of longing desire which turns
back from a nervous, colourless age,
from the prosiness of everyday life,
towards a vanished Saturnian era,
when man still lived at peace and
undisturbed in happy union with
nature. For even this proclaims him
our contemporary, that the temper of
his pictures develops itself from
the landscape. A landscape painter
through and through&mdash;almost in
B&oelig;cklin&rsquo;s sense, who transformed the temper of Nature into the
contemplation of living beings&mdash;he spoke of the rest and peace of
German forests, of that hour of summer&rsquo;s night when no wind blows, no
leaflet moves, when to the solitary wanderer in the woods the mists
rising from the meadows are transformed into white veils of the elves,
and the gold-rimmed waves of the sea into the yellow hair of mermaids
frolicking in the moonlight to the magic notes of their golden harps.
He felt and loved his landscapes rather than studied them, yet they are
saturated with an entirely modern sentiment for Nature. No German, at
that time, had caught and understood the interweaving of the forest boughs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page182" id="page182"></a>182</span>
with such intimate familiarity. The fresh sunshine of the morning breaks
through the light green of the young beeches, and leaps from bough to bough,
transforming the glittering dewdrops into diamonds, and the beetle, creeping
comfortably over the soft moss, into gold and precious stones. &ldquo;<i>Da gehet
leise nach seiner Weise der liebe Herrgott durch den Wald</i>&rdquo; (&ldquo;The dear God
holy, He passeth slowly, as His wont is, through the wood&rdquo;). With a few
boldly drawn lines and light colours we are transported into the midst of
the forest world, and all around us opening buds and verdurous green, sweet
scents, and the murmur of leaves. &ldquo;When one has set one&rsquo;s love and joy
on a beautiful tree so fully,&rdquo; he said to Ludwig Richter, &ldquo;one depicts all
one&rsquo;s love and joy with it, and then the tree looks quite different from an
ass&rsquo;s fine daub of what he thinks it should be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Only so intimate a connection with Nature could enable Schwind to
imagine landscapes, which in their virginal old-world mood form at once the
echo of the figures and of their actions. These green meadows and flower-besprent
hills, these gloomy wooded slopes, these smooth valleys through
which glittering waters glide murmuring along, are fit and suitable dwelling-places
for the delicate fabulous beings of the flower-entwined old fairy legends.
Schwind <i>lived</i> with Nature. He gave the name of Tanneck (Fir-tree Corner) to
the little country house which he built for himself on the Starnberger See, and
the fresh scent of pinewood, the rustling sound of German forests, pour forth
from his pictures. Like young Siegfried, he understood the language of birds,
and went eavesdropping to hear what the pine trees whispered to one another.</p>

<p>Still freer, more spontaneous, and lighter than in his oil paintings was his
touch in his water-colours, in which the colour is only breathed over the forms
like a delicate vapour; and quite especially in his illustrations&mdash;so far as the
word may be employed with respect to him, for he never illustrated, he gave
shape to his own thoughts, and that only which moved his innermost being
he brought fully formed before one&rsquo;s eye. The <i>Bilderbogen</i> and the <i>Fliegende
Blätter</i> of Munich obtained from him witty and humorous inventions, such
as &ldquo;The Almond Tree,&rdquo; &ldquo;Puss in Boots,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Peasant and the Donkey,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Herr Winter,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Acrobat Games.&rdquo; His fairest legacy consists of
three cyclic works: &ldquo;Cinderella,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Seven Ravens,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Beautiful
Melusina&rdquo;; wherein he glorified with praise the beauty and fidelity of women,
and their capacity for self-sacrifice. &ldquo;Cinderella,&rdquo; which appeared in 1855,
at the Munich Exhibition, is a fairy-tale, than which poet has seldom, indeed,
narrated a chaster, tenderer, or more fragrant. In 1858 followed the touching
story of the good sister who releases her brothers by dint of unspeakable
suffering and endurance, to-day the priceless pearl among the gems of the
Weimar collection. For twenty years, as he said, the work had been in his
thoughts. So far back as in 1844 he wrote to Genelli: &ldquo;I believe that it will
give something which may please people who have a sense for love and faithfulness,
and for a touch of the power of enchantment.&rdquo; When an acquaintance
of his gazed upon it with dismay, and ingenuously asked for whom the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page183" id="page183"></a>183</span>
thing was intended, and whither it was to go, Schwind turned his penetrating,
flashing little eyes upon him, and then said: &ldquo;Do you know, I painted that
for myself; it is the dream of my life; no one shall buy it; some day I shall
give it to a friend.&rdquo; It is an imperishable work, full of grace, modesty, and
charm.</p>

<p>Schwind takes the story up at the fateful moment when the lonely maiden,
who is determined to release her enchanted brothers by assiduous spinning and
constant silence, is discovered by a hunting party. There, amid the enchantment
of the forest solitude, she sits in the hollow of a tree and spins away at
the seven shirts, to free her seven brothers. Thus the king&rsquo;s son catches sight
of her. The fire of love kindles in his eyes. In one long kiss the maiden gives
herself to him. The wedding takes place, and like another St. Elizabeth she
is seen standing, soon afterwards, distributing alms to starving beggars.
Yet, meanwhile, she has fallen under suspicion owing to her continuous
silence; even her husband becomes distrustful, because in the quiet of night
he has observed that she is not resting by his side, but is quietly up and
spinning. And the catastrophe comes when the silent queen gives birth to
twins, who, to the horror of all around, fly off in the form of ravens. Tranquil
and affectionate, the young mother awaits her fate. Then follow the sentence
of the Vehm-tribunal, the pathetic parting from her husband, the preparation
for death. There is only one hour more to pass by before the seven years are
over and the spellbound brothers set free. The good fairy appears in the
air, hour-glass in hand, and brings solace to the hard-pressed heroine. The
beggars, too, whose benefactress she had been, bring help, and hold the gate of
the dungeon in force. So the time runs out, the spell is broken, and the
brothers hasten, on milk-white horses, to save their sister from the stake. In
Schwind&rsquo;s marvellous drawings the story passes quickly on, stroke by stroke,
deeply moving and soul-stirring in its dramatic force.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Beautiful Melusina&rdquo; was the kiss of the water-nymph, with which
Romanticism led her faithful knight to his death, only to disappear together
with him out of German art. &ldquo;The winter has dealt me a sore blow; I shall
never be able to do anything more.&rdquo; Carl Maria von Weber and Uhland had
already gone before; Schwind was lying on his sick-bed when the German
victories created a German fatherland. He learned, however, all the long
series of glorious tidings that came from the field of war, saw the tumultuous
joy and the dazzling sea of fire which surged through Munich in January 1871,
and heard the joyful news that Germany was at last united. Then he had a
glass of champagne poured out for him, and drank it to the new empire and
the future of the nation.</p>

<p>In the middle of a wood of lofty beeches in Bernrieder Park, on the Starnberger
See, there stands a small rotunda, within is a prattling fountain, right
round the walls runs a frieze, depicting the legend of the &ldquo;Beautiful
Melusina.&rdquo; It is Schwind&rsquo;s monument. With him German Romanticism
perished; reality itself had now become so marvellous. When, in 1850,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page184" id="page184"></a>184</span>
Hübner had to paint a figure of Germania
for a page in King Ludwig&rsquo;s
album, he depicted a queenly woman,
prone on the ground, with her face in
the dust, amidst a desolate landscape
and under a cloudy sky. The crown
has fallen from her head and a skull
lies by her side, while on the frame are
inscribed these words from the Book of
Lamentations: &ldquo;Mine eye runneth down
with rivers of water for the destruction
of the daughter of my people; the crown
of our head is fallen.&rdquo; When Schwind
died, Germany had re-arisen. In the
very year of his death, Lenbach painted
his first Bismarck pictures: in Bismarck
was embodied that power by means of
which the dream of a nation was fulfilled.</p>

<p>Thus Schwind&rsquo;s works are not only
the sign of a completed period in
German history, but also at the same
time both the climax and the conclusion
of an art-epoch. Schwind had
lived through the entire revolution
which German painting had at that time
undergone. At his death the sound of the hunting horns of Romanticism
had died away. He had lived long enough to have the opportunity
of criticising neatly, as follows, the dry, unpoetical school of historical
painting then making its appearance, as if introduced by gaudily costumed
models, a school which made its first hit with Lessing&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ezzelino&rdquo;:
&ldquo;I will explain the picture to you. Ezzelino is seated in his
dungeon, and two monks are attempting to convert him. One of them
recognises that all pains are thrown away upon the old sinner, and takes
himself off, regretfully desisting from all further endeavour; the other still has
hopes, and continues his exhortations. But Ezzelino only keeps his angry
gaze fixed before him, muttering, &lsquo;Leave me alone! Don&rsquo;t you see that I am&mdash;posing
as a model!&rsquo;&rdquo; He had had occasion to write to his friend Bauernfeld:
&ldquo;I have seen so many schools of so-called painting in my time that it is an
absolute horror to me&rdquo;; he had asked Piloty: &ldquo;What calamity are you
preparing for us now?&rdquo; and had thought it his duty to address to one of the
younger painters the question: &ldquo;Are we then an academy of the Fine or of the
Ugly Arts?&rdquo; &ldquo;A man like me, with his ideas, walks like a ghost amid the
battle of the virtuosi, in which the whole life of art has gone astray,&rdquo; he used
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page185" id="page185"></a>185</span>
sadly to say. His last wonderful
works stand alone in a time which
was dazzled by the flash of arms
characterising the Franco-Belgian
school of art. It was not till much
later that Hans Thoma took up the
threads which connect the work of
Schwind with the present epoch.
When he died he was a solitary,
isolated man taking leave of a
generation in which he had no part.
The period of historical painting which
followed him produced no single work
distinguished by Schwind&rsquo;s sense of
fragrant legendary poetry. The charming
forest fairy who had appeared to
him showed herself to no other; like
the betrayed Melusina, she had returned
to rest again, solitary, in her
fountain home. Fantasy, tender soul
that she is, had taken wings, whither
none can tell. &ldquo;That is why nobody
has a single idea,&rdquo; as Schwind said in
his drastic way. The Muse of Schwind,
the last Romanticist, was a chaste,
pensive, soulful maiden; while that
of Piloty, the first colourist, was a noisy, bloodthirsty Megæra. Yet one
can have no doubt as to the necessity of this evolutionary change.</p>

<p>Schwind himself is among the masters &ldquo;who have been, and are, and shall
be.&rdquo; He was different from all that was arising around him; he embodied
the spirit of the future, and exercises over the art of the present day so great an
influence that where two or three painters are gathered together in the name
of the beautiful, he has his place in the midst of them, and is present, invisible,
at every exhibition. But he exercises this influence only spiritually. Young
artists study him as if he were a primitive master. Enraptured, they find in
him all those qualities for which there is to-day so ardent a longing&mdash;innocent
purity and touching simplicity, a mystic, romantic submersion in waves of
old-time feeling and a charming youthful fervour. They do not study him in
order to <i>paint</i> like him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our heads are full of poetry, but we cannot give it expression,&rdquo; are the
words with which Cornelius himself characterised this period. Germany had
original geniuses indeed, but no fully matured school to compare with the
French; as yet the Germans did not know how to paint. Up to this time the
course of painting in Germany had been a bold but imprudent flight through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page186" id="page186"></a>186</span>
the air; in its Kaulbach-like cloud-heights it had melted away to a shadow,
only to fall again, somewhat roughly, to the ground. It died of an incurable
disease&mdash;idealism. The painters of that time, one and all, had never become
real artists; strictly speaking, they had always remained amateurs. He
alone is a great artist in whom the will and the performance, the substance and
the form, are in complete accordance. Painters who never knew exactly what
is meant by painting, artists whose most noticeable characteristic was that they
had no art-capacity, were only possible in the first half of the nineteenth
century in Germany, where for that very reason they were admired and praised.</p>

<p>What now began was a necessary making good what had been so long
neglected. For craftsmanship is the necessary presupposition of all art, which
can no longer suffer any one to be called a master who has not learnt his
business. In the atmosphere of incense which surrounded Cornelius in Munich,
the dogma that salvation was to be found in German art alone, and that the
German nation was the chosen people of art, had reached a height of self-adoration
which came near to megalomania. In the proud enthusiasm of those
times, great in their aims as in their errors, the Germans had as false an opinion
as possible of the art of foreign countries.</p>

<p>In the very years when the first railways were ousting the old mail-coaches
the mutual interchange of endeavour and ability between the various nations
was slower and scantier than ever before. How German artists had wandered
abroad in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, in that great age when Dürer
crossed the Alps on Pirkheymer&rsquo;s pony, and when Holbein obtained from
Erasmus letters of introduction for England! With what joy Dürer, in his
letters and in his journal, gives an account of the recognition accorded him
in artistic circles in Italy and the Dutch cities! Nearly all the German
painters had, in the course of their long wanderings, made acquaintance with
either the Netherlands or Italy. They knew exactly what was going on in the
world around them. Dürer and Raphael used to send drawings to each other,
&ldquo;so as to know each other&rsquo;s handwriting.&rdquo; It was only in the first half of the
nineteenth century that the Germans, once proud in the consciousness of
possessing the finest comprehension of, and the greatest receptivity for, foreign
intellectual wares, lived apart in timid isolation. Into the suburban still-life
of the German schools of art not a sound made its way of what was taking
place elsewhere. Only thus was it possible for the Germans to imagine that
among all modern nations they alone had a vocation for Art. No one had the
least idea that in England, the land of machines and beefsteaks, there were men
who painted; and people went so far as to proclaim piety, morality, thoroughness,
accurate draughtsmanship, and diligent execution the monopoly of
German art; and superficiality, frivolity, and &ldquo;empty straining after effect&rdquo;
the ineradicable national failing of that of France.</p>

<p>With some such ideas in their heads the majority of the German painters,
in the autumn of 1843, found themselves confronted by Gallait&rsquo;s &ldquo;Abdication
of Charles <span class="sc">V</span>&rdquo; and Bièfve&rsquo;s &ldquo;Agreement of the Dutch Nobility&rdquo;; two Belgian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id="page187"></a>187</span>
pictures which at that time were going the round of the exhibitions in all the
larger towns of Germany. And it was not long before the belief in the old
gods, which had for thirty years held sway in the city of King Ludwig, was
completely undermined by the younger generation. &ldquo;Even for the great gods,
day comes to an end. Night of annihilation, descend with the dusk!&rdquo; Diogenes
expelled from his philosophic tub could not have felt more uncomfortable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page188" id="page188"></a>188</span>
than the German painters in presence of the Belgian pictures. As till then
the incapacity to paint had been belauded as one of the strongest possible
proofs of the higher artistic nature and of genuine greatness, so now it was
perceived that nevertheless, on the banks of the Scheldt and of the Seine, a
much greater school of painting was in full bloom, and producing splendid
fruit.</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">In</span> France the first decade of the century gave no premonition of the
powerful development which was shortly to take place in French art.
A legion of characterless pupils issuing from David&rsquo;s studio wearied the
world with their aimless works, and hurled their thunderbolts against all
rising talent. The austere catalogue of the Salon was a pell-mell of Belisarii,
Télémaques, Phædras, Electras, Brutuses, Psyches, and Endymions. Girodet
and Guérin wearied themselves in putting on canvas the chief scenes in the
classical tragedies at that time so frequently performed&mdash;Pygmalion and
Galatea, the Death of Agamemnon, and the like&mdash;and painted portraits
between times; Girodet&rsquo;s dry and poor, Guérin&rsquo;s solemnly vacant. The
universal note was that of tedium.</p>

<p><i>François Gérard</i> alone, the &ldquo;King of Painters and Painter of Kings,&rdquo;
survives, at least in his portraits. Like David he is redeemed only by his
portrait painting, and his successes in that direction eclipse even Mme. Vigée-Lebrun,
the amiable, gifted, and graceful painter of Marie Antoinette&rsquo;s days.
At the outbreak of the Revolution she had left France. Everywhere extolled
and welcomed with open arms, she painted Mme. de Staël in Switzerland, and
at Naples Lady Hamilton, the famous beauty of the time of the Directory.
But when, in 1810, she returned to Paris, she had been forgotten. The day
on which Marie Antoinette picked up her brush for her, as Charles <span class="sc">V</span> had done
for Titian, was to remain the happiest in her life. She belonged to the Ancien
Régime, and although her death did not take place till 1842, at the age of
eighty-seven, her work was already over in 1792. In her old age she busied
herself in writing memoirs of the splendour of her youthful days, from the
famous mythological dinner in the Rue de Cléry, where her husband appeared
in the character of Pindar and recited his translation of Anacreon&rsquo;s odes, to the
triumphs which accompanied her journey round Europe.</p>

<p>Gérard took the place which she had left vacant at her departure, and
filled it well, especially in his youth. When, in the Exhibition of Portrait
Painting held at Paris in 1885, there appeared the likeness of Mlle. Brongniart,
from the collection of Baron Pichon, painted by Gérard in 1795, at the age
of twenty-five, there was general astonishment at the familiar and intimate
grasp of character it displayed. The portrait of this young girl standing in
her white dress, so tranquil and without pose, has in the firmness of its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page190" id="page190"></a>190</span>
draughtsmanship the austere charm and dignity of a Bronzino. And later
none could give to the aristocracy of Europe a nobler or more natural bearing
than did Gérard, who became their tried and trusted depicter: yet in his last
days he descended into theatrical exaggeration.
Endowed as he was with all the captivating
qualities of a cultured man of the world,
he had from the beginning avoided as the
plague the revolutionary politics in which
David was for some time engaged, and when
at the instance of the elder master he was
appointed a member of the Revolutionary
Tribunal, he alleged illness in order to be
absent from its sessions. He was a man of
the salons, the born painter of the great
world, his house the centre of a distinguished
circle of society. Not a celebrity, not an
emperor or king, but wished to be painted by
Gérard. And just as he had been the chosen
portrait painter of the Bonaparte family, so
after the Restoration he was still the official favourite of the Court. Josephine
took the fashionable painter under her high protection, Napoleon&rsquo;s marshals
defiled before him, and the aristocracy which returned with Louis <span class="sc">XVIII</span>
vied with one another for his favour.</p>

<p>Gérard&rsquo;s three hundred portraits are a continuous catalogue of all those
who in the first quarter of the century played any part in France upon the
political, military, or literary stage. A man of supple talent and fine tastes,
he completely satisfied the desires of a society which, after the storm of the
Revolution, opened its salons again and re-established its former hierarchy
of rank. The portrait with rich background of upholstery, and the depicting
of public ceremonies, were reintroduced by him into the field of art. The
people whom he painted are no longer &ldquo;citizens,&rdquo; as with David, but princes,
generals, princesses; and their surroundings allow of no doubt as to whether
they are to be addressed as Sir, as Your Serene Highness, or as Your Excellency.
No one knew how to flatter in so tactful a manner, particularly in portraits
of ladies. It was to him, therefore, that Mme. Récamier had recourse when
she was dissatisfied with David&rsquo;s likeness of her. Gérard&rsquo;s, which she destined
for Prince Augustus of Prussia, one of her admirers, gave the &ldquo;fair Juliette&rdquo;
the fullest satisfaction. In the former she was represented reposing on a
couch, austere and without charm, like a tragic muse. Here she sits in a
pleasant, lazy attitude upon a chair, in a transparent robe which fully displays
her form; about her lips plays a half-melancholy, half-coquettish smile, and
she, the great actress who had turned so many men&rsquo;s heads, gazes with gentle
child-eyes as innocently upon the world as though she believed the story
about babies and the stork.</p>

<p>The background, too, that colonnade &ldquo;leading nowhither,&rdquo; is characteristic
of the change in the manner of regarding things. The older schools of painting
had, in the case of portraits, managed the treatment of the background
in two different ways. The old Dutch and Germans&mdash;Jan van Eyck and
Holbein&mdash;aimed at showing a man, not only portrayed with the subtlest
fidelity to truth, but also in the surroundings in which he was usually or by
preference to be found. The Italians renounced all representation of such
scenes, and gave only a quiet, neutral tone to the background. Gorgeous
decorative scenery was introduced by the court painter Van Dyck, and since
the second half of the seventeenth century had continually risen in popular
favour. Mignard, Lebrun, and Rigaud had brought into fashion, for portraits
of princely personages, that stately pillared architecture, with broad velvet
curtains swelling and descending in ample folds, which at that time was so
remarkably in keeping with the whole cut of the costumes, with the enormous
full-bodied wigs and the theatrical attitudinising of that epoch. For the
likenesses of generals and warlike princes the favourite background was one
which represented, by means of a number of small figures, entire battles,
marches, sieges, and so forth. Both these methods, and, together with them,
that of an ideal, lightly indicated park landscape, were put an end to by the
Revolution, under the influence of
which all extravagant pomp, not only
in life, but even in portrait painting,
was replaced by an ascetic sobriety.
Gérard, the Court painter of the
Bourbons, who on their return had
&ldquo;learnt nothing and forgotten nothing,&rdquo;
reintroduced the gorgeous pillar
decoration, which still remained the
authoritative style under Stieler and
Winterhalter, and has only in the
<i>bourgeois</i> era of to-day given way to
the simple, neutral-toned background
of the Italians.</p>

<p>David, by the way, never forgave
Mme. Récamier for having preferred
his pupil to himself. When, in 1805,
after the completion of Gérard&rsquo;s likeness
of her, she approached David
on the subject of finishing his, he
answered drily: &ldquo;Madame, artists
have their caprices as well as women;
now it is <i>I</i> who will not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As an historical painter Gérard was
an imitator of the mannerist Girodet.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page192" id="page192"></a>192</span>
Paintings such as &ldquo;Daphnis and
Chloe,&rdquo; or the famous &ldquo;Psyche&rdquo;
receiving Cupid&rsquo;s first kiss (1798),
made indeed a great sensation
among the ladies, who for some
time afterwards painted their
faces white, to resemble the
gentle Psyche; but from the
artistic point of view they do
not rise above the ordinary level
of the Classical school. As an
historical painter he took much
the same course as David; he
began as a Revolutionist in 1795
with the usual &ldquo;Belisarius,&rdquo; and
ended as a Royalist with a
&ldquo;Coronation of Charles <span class="sc">X</span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The more stiff and sober the
antique style of David became,
the sooner a counter-current was
likely to arise, and the change of
taste showed itself first in the
circumstance that, from 1810 on,
a master came more and more to
the front who, already old, had
hitherto lived in obscurity,
almost despised by his contemporaries.
This was the amiable, sympathetic, charming, sweet, and
great <i>Prudhon</i>, the lineal descendant of Correggio, a solitary painter, the
gracefulness of whose art was at first unappreciated, but who, as the orthodox
academicians began to be more and more tedious, exercised a correspondingly
greater influence over the younger generation. He is the one refreshing oasis
in the desert wilderness of the Classical school.</p>

<p>What a difference between him and David! When the elegant grace of
Watteau fled from the French school, and the new Spartans dreamed of
founding a Greek art, David was the hero of this buskined theatrical school of
painting. He painted &ldquo;The Horatii&rdquo; and &ldquo;Brutus,&rdquo; and thought to bring
ancient Rome back to life by copying the shapes of old Roman chairs and old
Roman swords. That was the antique style of his first period. Later, having
made the discovery that, compared with the Greeks, the Romans were semi-barbarians,
he abandoned the Roman style, and thought to make a great stride
forwards by copying Greek statues and carefully transferring them to his
pictures. This &ldquo;pure Grecian character&rdquo; is represented in his &ldquo;Rape of the
Sabines.&rdquo; Later again, he turned to the more ancient Greeks, and the result
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page193" id="page193"></a>193</span>
was the most academic of his pictures, his &ldquo;Leonidas.&rdquo; A mixture of dryness
and declamatory pathos; diligence without imagination; able draughtsmanship
and an absolute incapacity of drawing anything whatever without a
model; careful arrangement without the slightest trace of that gift of the
inner vision whereby the whole is brought complete and finished before the
eye,&mdash;these exhaust the list of David&rsquo;s qualities. By means of casting and
copying he thought to come near to that art of the antique whose soul he
dreamed of embracing, when he held but its skeleton in his hands.</p>

<p>And meanwhile, away from the broad high-road, and almost unnoticed,
was living that painter whom David contemptuously called &ldquo;the Boucher of
his time.&rdquo; He it was who truly cherished the gods of Greece in his heart, under
whose brush the dead statues began to breathe and to feel the blood flowing in
their veins, as in the old days when the Renaissance dug them out of the
ground. His appearance on the stage indicates the first protest against the
rigid system pursued by the painter of the Horatii and of Brutus. Prudhon
also believed in the antique, but he saw therein a grace which no Classicist had
ever seen; he also contrasted the simplicity of the Grecian profile with the
capricious, wrinkled forms of the <i>rococo</i> style; he too had spent his youth in
Italy, but had not thought it
criminal to study Leonardo and
Correggio; he did not bind
himself either to cold sculpture
or to the delicate <i>morbidezza</i> of
the Lombards as the only means
of grace. He remained a
Frenchman heart and soul, in
that he inherited from Watteau&rsquo;s
age its womanly softness
and elegance. In a cold, ascetic
age he still believed in tenderness,
gaiety, and laughter&mdash;he
who as a man had but little
reason to take delight in life.</p>

<p>Prudhon was ten years
younger than David, and was
born at Cluny, the tenth child
of a poor stone cutter. He
grew up in miserable circumstances,
cherished only by a
mother who devoted the whole
of her love to this her youngest
born, and to whom the child,
a delicate pliant creature, clung
with girl-like tenderness. His
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page194" id="page194"></a>194</span>
parents used often to send him out with the other poor children of the
little town to gather faggots for the winter in the wood belonging to the
neighbouring Benedictine monastery. There the handsome, sprightly boy
with the large melancholy eyes attracted the notice of the priest, Père
Besson, who made him a chorister and gave him some instruction. Here,
in the old abbey of Cluny, surrounded by venerable statues carved in wood,
by old pictures of saints and artistic miniatures, he recognised his vocation.
An inner voice told him that he was to be a painter. And now his Latin
exercise books began to fill with drawings, and he carved little images with
his penknife out of wood, soap, or whatever came to his hand. He squeezed
out the juice of flowers, made brushes of horsehair, and began to paint. He
was inconsolable on finding that he could not hit off the colouring of the old
church pictures. It was a revelation to him when one of the monks said to
him one day: &ldquo;My boy, you will never manage it so: these pictures are
painted in oils&rdquo;; and he straightway invented oil painting for himself. With
the help of the instruction which he now received at Dijon from an able painter,
Devosge, he made rapid progress.</p>

<p>Nevertheless a generation
was yet to pass before
he was really to become a
painter. His marriage,
on 17th February 1778,
with the daughter of the
notary of Cluny, became
the torment of his life.
A linen-weaver and three
of his father-in-law&rsquo;s clerks
were present at the wedding.
His wife was quarrelsome,
their income
small, and their family
rapidly increasing. He
betook himself to Paris
to seek his fortune, with
a letter of introduction
to the engraver Wille.
&ldquo;Take pity on this youngster,
who has been married
for the last three years,
and who, were he to come
under some low fellow&rsquo;s
influence, might easily fall
into the most terrible
abyss&rdquo;; so ran the letter,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page195" id="page195"></a>195</span>
which a certain Baron Joursanvault had given him. He hired himself a
room in the house of M. Fauconnier, the head of a firm engaged in the lace
trade, who lived in the Rue du Bac with his wife and a pretty sister. The
latter, Marie, was eighteen years of age, and, like
Werther&rsquo;s Lotte, was always surrounded by her
brother&rsquo;s children, whom she looked after like a
little housewife. Prudhon, himself young, sensitive,
and handsome, loved and was loved, and made her
presents of small flattering portraits and pretty
allegorical drawings, in which Cupid was represented
scratching the initials M. F. (Marie Fauconnier) on
the wall with his arrow. That he was married and
several times a father she never knew, till one day
Madame Prudhon arrived with the children. &ldquo;And
you never told me!&rdquo; was her only word of reproach.</p>

<p>Prudhon himself now went to Italy&mdash;a journey
accompanied by serious difficulties. At Dijon he
had competed for the Prix de Rome, and had been
so simple as to make a sketch for one of his rivals.
He owed it to the latter&rsquo;s honesty that the scholarship
nevertheless fell to himself. He started on his
journey; but when he reached Marseilles, and was ready to embark, the vessel
was unable to weigh anchor for several weeks, owing to stormy weather. And
even on the voyage it became necessary to disembark again, so that months
had elapsed before he arrived in Rome, penniless, and having embraced,
according to classical custom, the land he had come to conquer; for he had
fallen out of the carriage on the way. Fortunately his dearly bought sojourn
in Italy did him no harm. He had indeed intended to draw only from the
antique and after Raphael; but after the lapse of a very few weeks he found
his ideal in Leonardo. Him he calls &ldquo;his Master and Hero, the inimitable
father and prince of all painters, in artistic power far surpassing Raphael!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a small sketch-book, half torn up, dating from this time, and still
in existence, we have already the whole Prudhon. It contains copies of
ancient statues, made laboriously and without pleasure in the work; then
comes Correggio&rsquo;s disarmed &ldquo;Cupid,&rdquo; a delicious little sketch, and with the
same pencil that drew it he has written down the names of the pictures he
purposes painting later on: &ldquo;Love,&rdquo; &ldquo;Frivolity,&rdquo; &ldquo;Cupid and Psyche.&rdquo;
It is as it were the secret confession of his fantasy, a preliminary announcement
of his future works. Here and there are found sketches hastily dashed
off of beautiful female forms in the graceful attitude which had excited his
admiration in the women of the &ldquo;Aldobrandini Wedding.&rdquo; But, above all,
the young artist observed all that was around him. He lived in unceasing
intercourse with the beautiful, and his soul was nurtured by the spirit of the
works which surrounded him. He accumulated pictures, not in his sketch-book,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page196" id="page196"></a>196</span>
but in himself; so much so that, when he was afterwards interrogated
as to his Italian studies, his only answer was: &ldquo;I did nothing but study life
and admire the works of the masters.&rdquo; He avoided association even with
scholars who had taken the Prix de Rome. The elegant and graceful sculptor
Canova was the only one with whom he permitted himself any intercourse.</p>

<p>When his scholarship had run its course, at the end of November 1789,
he found himself again in Paris, and the struggle against poverty began once
more. Even while in Italy he had sent all his savings to his wife, who had
straightway squandered them in drink with her brother, a sergeant in a
cavalry regiment. At Paris he had to act as parlour-maid and nursery-maid.
The faces of two more women rise up in his life like fleeting stars, and both
of them died before his eyes. The first was the mysterious stranger who
appeared one day in his studio and commissioned him to paint her portrait.
She was young, scarcely twenty years of age, with great blue eyes, but her
face was weary and wan as though from long sleepless nights. &ldquo;Your portrait?&rdquo;
asked Prudhon, &ldquo;with features so troubled and sad?&rdquo; He set to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page197" id="page197"></a>197</span>
work, silent and indifferent; but with every stroke of his brush he felt himself
more mystically attracted to this young girl, evidently as unhappy and as
persecuted by fate as himself. She promised to return on the morrow;
but neither on that day nor on the next did she appear. One afternoon he
was wandering dreamily along the street, thinking of the unknown fair one,
when his eye almost mechanically caught sight of the guillotine, and he
recognised in the unhappy victim at that very moment ending her days the
mysterious visitor of his studio.</p>

<p>To keep the wolf from the door, Prudhon was obliged for some years to
draw vignettes on letter-sheets for the Government offices, business cards for
tradesmen, and even little pictures for <i>bonbonnières</i>. For this the representatives
of high art held him in contempt. Greuze alone treated him amicably,
and even he held out no hopes for his future. &ldquo;You have a family
and you have talent, young man; that is enough in these days to bring about
one&rsquo;s death by starvation. Look at my cuffs.&rdquo; Then the old man would
show him his torn shirt-sleeves&mdash;for even he could no longer find means of
getting on in the new order of things. To his anxieties about the necessities
of life were added dissensions with his wife. He became the prey of a continual
melancholy; he was never seen to smile. Even when a separation
had been effected his tormentor persecuted him still, until she was relegated
to a madhouse. But now a change comes over the scene with the entrance
of Constance Mayer.</p>

<p>This amiable young painter, his pupil, was the star that lighted up his
old age. She was ugly. With her brown complexion, her broad flat nose,
and her large mouth, she
had at first sight the appearance
of a mulatto. Yet to
this large mouth belonged
voluptuous lips ever ready
to be kissed; above this
broad nose there were two
eyes shining like black
diamonds, which by their
changeful expression made
this irregular, <i>gamin&rsquo;s</i> face
appear positively beautiful.
She was seventeen years his
junior, and he has painted
her as often as Rembrandt
painted his Saskia. He has
immortalised the dainty upturned
nose of his little
gipsy, as he called her, in
pictures, sketches, pastels,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page198" id="page198"></a>198</span>
all of which have the same piquant charm, the same elegant grace, the same
joyous and merry expression. In her he had found his type, as his namesake
Rubens did in Hélène Fourment. Constance Mayer became the muse of his
delicate, graceful work. And she too died before his eyes, having cut her
throat with a razor.</p>

<p>The master and the pupil loved each other. As sentimental as she was
passionate, as gay as she was piquant, nervous and witty, she possessed every
quality that was likely to captivate him, as she chattered to him in her lively
and original way, and flattered his pride as an artist. This love seemed to
promise him rest and a bright ending for his days. He entered into it with
the passion of a young man in love for the first time. Mlle. Mayer, after
her father&rsquo;s death, was dependent on no one. Her studio in the Sorbonne
was separated from her master&rsquo;s only by a blind wall. She was with him the
entire day, worked at his side, was his housekeeper, and saw to the education
of his daughter, to whom she was at once a mother and an elder sister; and
Prudhon transferred to her all the tender love which as a child he had cherished
for his mother. In his gratitude he wished to share his genius with his friend,
and to make her famous like
himself. It is pathetic to
note in Mlle. Mayer&rsquo;s studies
with what patience and devotion
he instructed her, how
he strove to animate her
with his own spirit, and to
give her something of his
own immortality. Even his
own work was influenced by
the new happiness. To the
period of his connection with
Constance belong his masterpieces,
&ldquo;Justice and Vengeance,&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Rape of
Psyche,&rdquo; &ldquo;Venus and
Adonis,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Swinging
Zephyr.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These brought him at
last even outward success.
In 1808 the Emperor gave
him the Cross of the Legion
of Honour for his picture of
&ldquo;Justice and Vengeance,&rdquo;
and he became, if not the
official, at least the familiar
painter of the Court. The
fine portrait of the Empress Josephine
belongs to this period. When the new
Empress Marie Louise wished to learn
the art of painting, Prudhon, in 1811,
became her drawing master; and when
on the birth of the King of Rome the
city of Paris presented to the Emperor
the furniture for a room, he was commissioned
to provide the artistic decoration.
Criticism began to bow its head
when his name was mentioned; and
the younger generation of painters soon
discovered in him, once so contemptuously
reviled, the founder of a new
religion, the want of which had long
been felt. He began to make money.
Constance Mayer seemed to bring him luck: her death affected him all the
more deeply.</p>

<p>By nature nervous and highly strung, jealous and keenly conscious of her
equivocal position, she could not make up her mind, when the painters were
ordered to move their studios from the Sorbonne, either to leave Prudhon or
openly to live with him. On the morning of 26th March 1821 she left her
model, the little Sophie, alone, after giving her a ring. Soon afterwards a
heavy fall was heard, and she was found lying on the ground in a pool of blood.
Prudhon lingered on for two years more, two long years spent as it were in
exile. Solitary, tortured by remorse of conscience, and with continual thoughts
of suicide, he lived on only for his recollections of her, in tender converse
with the memorials she had left, insensible to the renown which began gradually
to gather round his name. The completion of the &ldquo;Unfortunate Family,&rdquo;
which Constance had left unfinished on her easel, was his last <i>tête-à-tête</i> with
her, his last farewell. He left his studio only to visit her grave in Père-Lachaise,
or to wander alone along the outer boulevards. An &ldquo;Ascension of
the Virgin&rdquo; and a &ldquo;Christ on the Cross&rdquo; were the last works of the once
joyous painter of ancient mythology: the Mater Dolorosa and the Crucified&mdash;symbols
of his own torments. Death at length took compassion upon him.
On the 16th of February 1823 France lost Prudhon.</p>

<p>His art was the pure expression of his spiritual life. His life was swayed
by women, and something feminine breathes through all his pictures. In
them there speaks a man full of soul, originally of a joyous nature, who has
gone through experiences which prevented him ever being joyous again. He
has inherited from the <i>rococo</i> style its graces and its little Cupids, but has
also already tasted of all the melancholy of the new age. With his smiles
there is mingled a secret sadness. He has learnt that life is not an unending
banquet and a perpetual pleasure; he has seen how tragic a morrow follows
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page202" id="page202"></a>202</span>
upon the voyage to the Isle of Cythera. The bloom has faded from his pale
cheeks, his brow is furrowed&mdash;he has seen the guillotine. He, the last <i>rococo</i>
painter and the first Romanticist, would have been truly the man to effect
the transition from the eighteenth to the nineteenth century by a path more
natural than that followed by David.</p>

<p>Even his fugitive sketches, thrown off in the days of his poverty, have a
quite peculiar charm and a thoroughly individual sentiment. There are
vignettes of his for letter-sheets, done for the Government offices, which in a
few pencil touches contain more manly elegance and poetry than do David&rsquo;s
most pretentious compositions with all their borrowed Classicism. Prudhon
was the only painter who at that time produced anything of conspicuous merit
in the art of ornament. Even drawings such as &ldquo;Minerva uniting Law and
Liberty,&rdquo; which from their titles would lead one to expect nothing more than
frozen allegories, are imbued, not with David&rsquo;s coldness, but with Correggio&rsquo;s
charm. French grace and elegance are united, without constraint, to the
beauty of line found in ancient cameos. He it was who first felt again the
living poetry of that old mythology, which had become a mere collection of
dry names. He is commissioned to draw a card of invitation for a ball, and
he sends a tender hymn on music and dancing. In extravagant profusion he
scatters forth, no matter where, poetic invention and grace such as David in
his most strenuous efforts sought for in vain. It was during this time that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page203" id="page203"></a>203</span>
Prudhon became the admirable draughtsman to whom the French school
have awarded a place among their greatest masters. These drawings and
illustrations were the necessary preparation for the great works which brought
him to the front at the beginning of the century.</p>

<p>Even his first picture, painted in 1799&mdash;to-day half-destroyed&mdash;&ldquo;Wisdom
bringing Truth upon the earth, at whose approach Darkness vanishes,&rdquo; must,
to judge from early descriptions, have been marked by a seductive and delicate
grace. And the celebrated work of 1808, &ldquo;Justice and Vengeance pursuing
Crime,&rdquo; belongs certainly, so far as colouring is concerned, rather to the
Romantic than to the Classical era. For during the latter, one faculty
especially had been lost, and that was the art of painting flesh. Prudhon, by
deep study of Leonardo and Correggio, masters at that time completely out
of fashion, won back this capacity for the French school. In wild and desolate
scenery, above which the moon, emerging from behind heavy clouds, shines
with a ghostly light upon the bare rocks, the murderer is leaving the body of
his victim. He strides forth with hasty steps, purse and dagger in hand,
glancing back with a shudder at the naked corpse of a young man which has
fallen upon a ledge of rock, lying there stiff and with outstretched arms.
Above, like shapes in the clouds, the avenging goddesses are already sweeping
downwards upon him. Justice pursues the fugitive with threatening, wrathful
glance; while Vengeance, lighting the way with her torch, stretches out her
hand to grasp the guilty one. In that epoch this picture stands alone for the
imposing characterisation of the persons, for its powerful pictorial execution,
and the stern and grandiose landscape which serves as setting to the awful
scene.</p>

<p>In general, Prudhon was not a tragic painter; his preference was for the
more joyous, light and dreamy, delicately veiled myths of the ancients. His
misfortunes taught him to flee from reality, and on the wings of Art he saved
himself, in the realm of legendary love and visionary happiness. So we see
Psyche borne aloft by Zephyr through the twilight to the nuptial abode of
Eros. A soft light falls upon her snowy body; her head has fallen upon her
shoulder, and one arm, bent backwards,
enframes her face. Silent
like a cloud, the group moves onward&mdash;a
sweet-scented apparition
from fairyland. Now, enraptured
genii visit the slumbering Fair One
in forest-shadows, under the shimmering
moon; now she is stealing
secretly down to bathe in a tranquil
lake, and gazes with astonishment
upon her own likeness in the gloomy
mirror. Here Venus, drawing deep
breaths of secret bliss, is seated, full
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page204" id="page204"></a>204</span>
of longing love, by the side of Adonis. Who else, at that time, could draw
nude figures of such faultless beauty, so slender and pure, with lines so
supple and yet so firm, and enveloped in so full and soft a light? Or
again, he paints Zephyr swinging roguishly by the side of a stream. A gentle
breeze plays through his locks, and the cool darkness of the wood breathes
through all things round.</p>

<p>Prudhon&rsquo;s work is never a laborious patchwork of fragments of antique forms
picked up here and there, never the insipid product of the reason working in
accordance with recipes long handed down; it is thoroughly intuitive. Never
keeping too closely to his model, he gave to his creations the movement and the
divine breath of life. In his hands with dreamlike fidelity the Antique rose up
again renewed, new in the sense of his own completely modern sentiment,
and in that of those great masters of the Renaissance who had wakened it to
life three hundred years before. For Prudhon, as is shown by his landscape
backgrounds, is altogether Jean Jacques Rousseau&rsquo;s contemporary, the child
of that epoch in which Nature revealed itself anew; and, as is proved by his
figures, he is a congenial spirit to Antonio da Allegri and Vinci. In fresh
recollection of Correggio, he loves a soft exuberance of flesh and a delicate
semi-obscurity; in enthusiastic reverence for Leonardo, those heads of women,
with deep, sensuously veiled eyes,
and that mysterious delicate smile
playing dreamily round the wanton
mouth. Only, the enchanting sweetness
of the Florentine and the
delicious ecstasy of the Lombard
are toned down by a gentle
melancholy which is entirely modern.
The Psyche borne up to heaven by
Zephyr changes in the end, when
purified and refined, into the soul
itself, which, in the form of the
Madonna, ascends into heaven,
transfigured with longing desire;
and Venus, the goddess of love, is
transformed into Love immortal,
&ldquo;Who, stretched upon the Cross,
yet reacheth out His hand to thee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This man, with his soft tenderness
and fine feeling for the eternal
feminine, was as though fashioned
by Nature to be the painter of
women of his time. If David was
the chief depicter of male faces
bearing a strong impress of character,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id="page205"></a>205</span>
delicate, refined, womanly natures found their best interpreter in
Prudhon. His heads of women charm one by the mysterious language of
their eyes, by their familiar smile, and by their dreamy melancholy. No one
knew better how to catch the fleeting expression in its most delicate shades,
how to grasp the very mood of the moment. How piquant is his smiling
Antoinette Leroux with her dress <i>à la</i> Charlotte Corday, her coquettish extravagant
hat, and all the amusing &ldquo;chic&rdquo; of her toilette! Madame Copia, the
wife of the engraver, with her delicately veiled eyes, has become in Prudhon&rsquo;s
hands the very essence of a beautiful soul. A languishing weariness, a remarkable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page206" id="page206"></a>206</span>
mingling of Creole grace and gentle melancholy, breathes over the
portrait of the Empress Josephine. She is represented seated on a grassy
bank in a dignified yet negligent attitude, her head slightly bent, her gaze
wandering afar with a look of uncertain inquiry, as though she had some faint
presentiment of her coming misfortune; and the dreamy twilight-shadows of
a mysterious landscape are gathering around her.</p>

<p>Coming after a period of colour asceticism, Prudhon was the first to show
a fine feeling for colour. Even during the revolutionary era he protested
in the name of the graceful against David&rsquo;s formal stiffness. He sought to
demonstrate that human beings do not in truth differ very widely to-day from
those in whom Leonardo and Correggio delighted, that they are fashioned out
of delicate flesh and blood, not out of marble and stone. Standing beside
David, he appealed to the art of colour. But as with André Chénier, a spirit
congenial to his, it was long before he attained success. His modesty and
his rustic character could effect nothing against the dictatorial power of David,
on whom had been showered every dignity that Art could offer. People
continued to ridicule poor Prudhon, who worked only after his own fantasy,
who had fashioned for himself in <i>chiaroscuro</i> a poetic language of his own, till
the question was raised again from another side, and this time by a young
man who came directly out of David&rsquo;s studio.</p>

<p><i>Antoine Jean Gros</i> was one of David&rsquo;s pupils, and stood out among his
fellows as the one most submissively devoted to his master; yet it was he
who, without wishing it or knowing of it, was preparing the way for the overthrow
of David&rsquo;s school. He was born 17th March 1771, at Paris, where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page207" id="page207"></a>207</span>
his father was a miniature painter. His vocation was determined in the
studio of Mme. Vigée-Lebrun, who was a friend of his parents. In the Salon of
1785, which contained David&rsquo;s &ldquo;Andromache beside the Body of Hector,&rdquo;
he chose his instructor. He was then the handsome youth of fifteen represented
in his portrait of himself at Versailles, with delicate features, full of
feeling, on which lies an amiable, gentle cast of sentimentality. Two large,
dark-brown eyes look out upon the world astonished and inquiring, dark hair
surrounds the quiet, fresh face, and over it is cocked a broad-brimmed felt
hat. In this picture we see a fine-strung, sensitive nature, a soul which would
be plunged by bitter experiences into depths of despair, in proportion as
success would raise it to heights of ecstasy. In 1792 he competed unsuccessfully
for the Prix de Rome, and this failure was the making of him.</p>

<p>He went to Italy on his own account, and was an eye-witness of the war
which Napoleon was there waging. There he beheld scenes in which archæology
had no part. For when Augereau&rsquo;s foot-soldiers carried the bridge
of Arcola by assault, they had little thought of imitating an antique bas-relief.
Gros observed armies on the march, and saw their triumphant entry into
festally decorated cities. He learnt his lesson on the field of battle, and on
his return placed on record what he had himself gone through. In Italy he
caught the poetry of modern life, and at the same time was enabled as a
painter to supplement David&rsquo;s lectures with the teaching of another surpassing
master. It was in Genoa that he became acquainted with Rubens. As
Prudhon&rsquo;s originality consisted in the fact that he was the first of
that period again to stand dreaming before Leonardo and Correggio, so did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page208" id="page208"></a>208</span>
Gros&rsquo; lie in this, that he studied Rubens at a time when the Antwerp master
was also completely out of fashion. His instinct as a painter had at the very
commencement guided him to Rubens&rsquo; &ldquo;St. Ignatius,&rdquo; which in his letters
he described as a &ldquo;sublime and magnificent work.&rdquo; When he was subsequently
appointed a member of the Commission charged with the transference
of works of art to Paris, he had abundant opportunities of admiring
critically the works of the sixteenth and seventeenth century masters. The
two impressions thus received had a decisive effect upon his life. Gros became
the great colourist of the Classical school, the singer of the Napoleonic
epos. Compared with David&rsquo;s marmoreal Græco-Romans, Gros&rsquo; figures seem
to belong to another world; his pictures speak, both in purport and in technique,
a language which must more than once have astonished his master.</p>

<p>He was fortunate enough to be presented to Josephine Beauharnais, and
through her to Bonaparte, in the Casa Serbelloni at Milan; and Gros, whose
earnest desire it was to paint the great commander, was appointed a lieutenant
on his staff. He had occasion, in the three days&rsquo; battle of Arcola, to admire
the Dictator&rsquo;s impetuous heroism; and he made a sketch of the General
storming the bridge of Arcola at the head of his troops, ensign in hand. It
pleased Napoleon, who saw
in it something of the
dæmonic power of the future
conqueror of the world;
and when the picture was
exhibited in Paris in 1801
it met there also with the
most striking success. The
greater warmth of colour,
the broader sweep of the
brush, and the life-like
movement of the figures
seemed, in comparison with
David&rsquo;s monotonous manner,
to be far-reaching innovations.</p>

<p>With his &ldquo;Napoleon on
the Bridge of Arcola&rdquo; Gros
had found his peculiar
talent. What his teacher
had accomplished as painter
to the Convention, Gros
carried to a conclusion in
that span of time during
which Napoleon lived in the
minds of his people as a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id="page209"></a>209</span>
hero. He too made an occasional excursion into the domain of Greek
mythology, but he did not feel at home there. His field was that living
history which the generals and soldiers of France were making. He won
for contemporary military life its citizenship in art. David, wishing to
remain true to &ldquo;history&rdquo; and to &ldquo;style,&rdquo; had depicted contemporary events
with reluctance. What Gérard and Girodet had produced was interesting as
a protest on the part of reality against classical convention, but on the whole it
was unsatisfying and wearisome. Gros, the famous painter of the &ldquo;Plague of
Jaffa&rdquo; and of the &ldquo;Battle of Eylau,&rdquo; was the first to attain to high renown in
this field.</p>

<p>These are two powerful and genuine pictures, two pre-eminent works which
will endure. Gros stands far above David and all his rivals in his power of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page210" id="page210"></a>210</span>
perception. The elder painter is now out of date, while Gros remains ever
fresh, because he painted under the impulse given by real events, and not
under the ban of empty theories. A realist through and through, he did not
shrink from representing the horrible, which antique art preferred to avoid.
In an epoch when Rome and Greece were the only sources of inspiration he
had the courage to paint a hospital, with its sick, its dying, and its dead. When
in the Egypto-Syrian campaign the plague broke out after the storming of
Jaffa, Napoleon, accompanied by a few of his officers, undertook, on 7th March
1799, to visit the victims of the pestilence. This act deserved to be celebrated
in a commemorative picture. Gros took it in hand, and represented Napoleon,
in the character of consoler, amid the agonising torments of the dying; deviating
from historical accuracy only so far as to transfer the scene from the
wretched wards of the lazaretto to the courtyard of a pillared mosque. In
the shadows of the airy halls sick and wounded men twist and writhe, stare
before them in despair, rear themselves up half-naked in mortal pain, or turn
to gaze upon the Commander-in-Chief, a splendid apparition full of youthful
power, who is tranquilly feeling the plague boils of one of their comrades.
Here and there Orientals move in picturesque costumes, distributing the food
which negro lads are bringing in. And beyond, over the battlements of the
Moorish arcades, one sees the town with its fortifications, its flat roofs and
slender minarets, over which flutter the victorious banners of the French.
On one side lies the distant, glittering blue sea, and over all stretches the clear,
glowing southern sky.</p>

<p>Like a new gospel, like the first gust of wind preceding the storm of
Romanticism, this picture standing in the Louvre, surrounded by its stiff
Classical contemporaries, excites a sensation of pleasure.</p>

<p>Gros&rsquo; heroes know, as
David&rsquo;s do, that they are
important, and show it perhaps
too much, but at least
they act. The painter felt
what he was painting, and
an impulse of human love,
an heroic and yet human
life, permeates the picture.
Moreover, Gros did not content
himself with the scanty
palette and the miserable
cartoon-draughtsmanship of
his contemporaries. This
treatment of the nude, these
despairing heads of dying
men, show none of the stony
lifelessness of the Classical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page211" id="page211"></a>211</span>
school; this Moorish courtyard has no resemblance to the tragedy peristyle
so habitually employed up to that time; this Bonaparte laying his hand
upon the dying man&rsquo;s sores is no Greek or Roman hero. The sick men
whose feverish eyes gaze upon him as on the star of hope, the negroes
going up and down with viands, are no mere supernumeraries; the sea
lying in sunshine beyond, full of bustling sails, and the harbour gaily
decked with many-coloured flags, point in their joyous splendour of colouring
to the dawn of a new era. The young artists were not mistaken when,
in the Salon of 1804, they fastened a sprig of laurel to the frame of the
picture. The State bought it for sixteen thousand francs. A banquet at
which Vien and David presided was given in honour of the painter. Girodet
read a poem, of which the conclusion ran as follows&mdash;</p>

<p>In his &ldquo;Battle of Eylau,&rdquo; exhibited in 1808, Gros has given us a companion
picture to the &ldquo;Plague of Jaffa&rdquo;: in one a visit to a hospital, in the other the
inspection of a field of battle after the fight is over. The dismal grey hue of
winter rests upon the white sheet of snow stretching desolately away to the
horizon, only interrupted here and there by hillocks beneath which annihilated
regiments sleep their last sleep. In the foreground lie dead bodies heaped
together, and moaning wounded men; and in the midst of this horror of
mangled limbs and corrupting flesh he, the Conqueror, the Master, the Emperor,
comes to a halt, pale, his eyes turned towards the cities burning on the horizon,
in his grey overcoat and small cocked hat, at the head of his staff, indifferent,
inexorable, merciless as Fate. &ldquo;<i>Ah! si les rois pouvaient contempler ce
spectacle, ils scraient moins avides de conquêtes.</i>&rdquo; The classical posturing which
still lingered, a disturbing element, in the Plague picture, has been put aside
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page212" id="page212"></a>212</span>
completely. The conventional
horse from the frieze
of the Parthenon, which
David alone knew, has
given way to the accurately
observed animal, and the
colouring too, in its sad
harmony, has fully recovered
its ancient right of giving
character to the picture.
It was, beyond all controversy,
the chief work in the
Salon of 1808, rich in remarkable
pictures; neither
Gérard&rsquo;s &ldquo;Battle of Austerlitz,&rdquo;
nor Girodet&rsquo;s &ldquo;Atala,&rdquo;
nor David&rsquo;s Coronation piece
endangered Gros&rsquo; right to
the first place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Napoleon before the
Pyramids,&rdquo; at the moment
when he cries, &ldquo;Soldiers,
from the summit of those
monuments forty centuries
contemplate your actions,&rdquo; constitutes, in 1810, the coping-stone of the
cycle. Gros alone at that time understood the epic grandeur of war.
He became, also, the portrait painter of the great men from whom its
events proceeded. His picture of General Masséna, with its meditative,
slily tenacious expression, is the genuine portrait of a warrior; and how
well is heroic, simple daring depicted in the likeness of General Lasalle,
without the commonplace device of a mantle puffed out by the wind!
His portrait of General Fournier Sarlovèse, at Versailles, has a freshness
of colouring, the secret of which no one else possessed in those days except
the two Englishmen, Lawrence and Raeburn. Gros was far in advance
of his age. A painter of movement rather than of psychological analysis,
he brought out character by means of general effect, and gave the
essentials in a masterly way. His portraits, just as much as his historical
pictures, have a stormy exposition. In David all is calculation; in Gros,
fire. Almost alone among his contemporaries, he had studied Rubens,
and like him gave colour the place due to it. At times there is in his
pictures a natural flesh-colour and an animation which make this warm-hearted
man, who has not been sufficiently appreciated, a genuine forerunner
of the moderns. Surrounded as he was by orthodox Classicists,
he cried in a loud voice what Prudhon had already ventured to say
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page213" id="page213"></a>213</span>
more timidly: &ldquo;Man is not a statue&mdash;not made of marble, but of flesh
and bone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But as with Prudhon, so with Gros. This man, of exaggerated nervousness,
was lacking in that capacity for persistence which belongs to a strong
will conscious of its aim; he lacked confidence in himself and in the initiative
he had taken. So long as the great figure of Napoleon kept his head above
water he was an artist; but when his hero was taken from him he sank. The
Empire had made Gros great, its fall killed him. The incubus of David&rsquo;s
antique manner began once more to press upon him, and when David after
his banishment (in 1816) committed to him the management of his studio
in Paris, Gros undertook the office with pious eagerness, on nothing more
anxiously intent than as a teacher once more to impose the fetters of the
antique upon that Art which he had set free by his own works. &ldquo;It is not
I who am speaking to you,&rdquo; he would say to the pupils, &ldquo;but David, David,
always David.&rdquo; The latter had blamed him for having taken the trouble to
paint the battles of the Empire, &ldquo;worthless occasional pieces,&rdquo; instead of
venturing upon those of
Alexander the Great, and
thus producing genuine
&ldquo;historical works.&rdquo; &ldquo;Posterity
requires of you good
pictures out of ancient
history. Who, she will cry,
was better fitted to paint
Themistocles? Quick, my
friend! turn to your Plutarch.&rdquo;
To depict contemporary
life, which lies open
before our eyes, was, he held,
merely the business of minor
artists, unworthy the brush
of an &ldquo;historical painter.&rdquo;
And Gros, who reverenced
his master, was so weak as
to listen to his advice: he
believed in him rather than
in his own genius, in the
strength of others rather than
his own. He searched his
Plutarch, and painted nothing
more without a previous
side-glance towards Brussels;
introduced allegory into his
&ldquo;Battle of the Pyramids&rdquo;;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page214" id="page214"></a>214</span>
composed in homage to David a &ldquo;Death of Sappho&rdquo;; and painted the
cupola of the Pantheon with stiff frescoes; while between times, when he
looked Nature in the face, he was now and then producing veritable masterpieces.</p>

<p>His &ldquo;Flight of Louis <span class="sc">XVIII</span>&rdquo; in the Museum at Versailles, shows him
once more at his former height. It is &ldquo;one of the finest of modern works,&rdquo;
as Delacroix called it in 1848, in an essay contributed to the <i>Revue des Deux
Mondes</i>; at once familiar and serious. Napoleon had left Elba, marched
on Paris, and had reached Fontainebleau, when, in the night of the 19th-20th
March 1815, Louis <span class="sc">XVIII</span> determined to evacuate the Tuileries with
all speed. Accompanied by a few faithful followers and by the officers of
his personal service, he abandons his palace and takes leave of the National
Guards. There is something pathetic in this sexagenarian with his erudite
Bourbon profile, immortalised in the large five-franc pieces of his reign,
with his protruding stomach and small thick legs, looking like a dropsical
patient going to hospital. His bearing is most unkingly. Gros has boldly
depicted the scene, even to the pathological appearance of the king, just as
he saw it, forgetting all that he knew of antique art. He had himself seen
the staircase, the murmuring
crowd, the lackeys hurrying
by, lantern in hand, at their
wits&rsquo; end, and the fat, gouty
king, who in his terror has
forgotten all kingly dignity.</p>

<p>That was an historical
picture, and yet as he painted
it he reproached himself
anew for having forsaken
the &ldquo;real art of historical
painting.&rdquo; At the funeral
of Girodet in 1824 the members
of the Institute talked
of their &ldquo;irreparable loss,&rdquo;
and of the necessity of finding
a new leader for the
school who should avert
with a strong hand that destruction
which hot-headed
young men threatened to
bring upon it. &ldquo;You,
Gros,&rdquo; observed one of them,
&ldquo;should be the man for the
place.&rdquo; And Gros answered,
in absolute despair; &ldquo;Why,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page215" id="page215"></a>215</span>
I have not only no authority as leader of a school, but, over and above
that, I have to accuse myself of giving the first bad example of defection
from real art.&rdquo;  The more he thought of David, the more he turned his
back upon the world of real life. With his large and wearisome picture
of &ldquo;Hercules causing Diomedes to be devoured by his own Horses&rdquo; (1835)
he sealed his own fate. Conventionality had conquered nature.</p>

<p>The painters overwhelmed him with ridicule, and a shrill shout of derision
rose from all the critics. Already, for some time past, a few writers had risen
to protest against the Classical school. They spoke with fiery eloquence of
the rights of humanity, the benefits of liberty, the independence of thought,
the true principles of the Revolution, and found numerous readers. They
fought against rigid laws in the intellectual as well as the social sphere; they
pointed out that there were other worlds besides that of antiquity, and that
even the latter was not peopled exclusively by cold statues; they delighted
in describing the great and beautiful scenes of Nature, and opened out once
more a new and broad horizon to art and poetry. The Spring was awakening;
Gros felt that he had outlived himself. Arming himself against the voices
of the new era with the fatal heroism of the deaf, he became the martyr of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page216" id="page216"></a>216</span>
Classicism in French art. He was a Classic by education, a Romantic by
temperament; a man who took his greatest pride in giving the lie as a teacher
to the work he had accomplished as an artist, and this discordance was his
ruin.</p>

<p>On the 25th of June 1835, being sixty-four years of age, he took up his
hat and stick, left his house without a word to any one, and laid himself
face-downwards in a tributary of the Seine near Meudon. It was a shallow
place, scarce three feet deep, which a child could easily have waded through.
It was not till next day, when he had been dead for twenty-four hours, that
he was discovered by two sailors walking home along the bank. One of
them struck his foot against a black silk hat. In it there was a white cravat
marked with the initial G., carefully folded, and upon it a short note to his
wife. On a torn visiting-card could still be read the name, Baron Gros. A little
farther on they saw the corpse, and as they were afraid to touch a drowned
man, they drew lots with straws to decide which of them should pull him out.
&ldquo;I feel it within me, it is a misfortune for me to be alone. One begins to be
disgusted with one&rsquo;s self, and then all is over,&rdquo; he had once in his youth
written to his mother with gloomy foreboding. Such was the end of a master
every fibre of whose being was in revolt against Classicism, and who had so
great a love for colour, truth, and life.</p>

<p>More important events were yet to take place before the signal of
deliverance could be expected. It was the young men who had grown
up amid the desolate associations of the Restoration who were to lead
to victory the new movement of which Prudhon and Gros had been the
forerunners. The dictatorship over art of that Classical school which had
been taken over from the seventeenth century was limited to a single
generation&mdash;from the birththroes of the Revolution to the fall of the
Napoleonic Empire. For although many of David&rsquo;s pupils survived
until the middle of the century, yet they
were merely academic big-wigs, who, compared
with the young men of genius who
were storming their positions, represent
that mediocrity which had indeed attained
to external honours, but had
remained stationary, fast bound to antiquated
rules. The future belonged to
the young, to a youth which from the
standpoint of our own days seems even
younger than youth commonly is, richer,
fresher, more glowing and fiery&mdash;the
Generation of 1830, the &ldquo;<i>vaillants de
dix-huit cent trente</i>,&rdquo; as Théophile Gautier
called them in one of his poems.</p>

<p class="center chap2">THE GENERATION OF 1830</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">During</span> the years which elapsed between 1820 and 1848 France produced
a great and admirable school of art. After the convulsions of
the Revolution and the wars of the Empire, that generation had arisen, daring
and eager for action, which de Musset describes in his <i>Confessions d&rsquo;un Enfan
du Siècle</i>. And these young men, born between the thunders of one battle
and another, who had grown up in the midst of greatness and glory, had to
experience, as they ripened into manhood, the ignominy of Charles <span class="sc">X</span>&rsquo;s reign,
the period of clerical reaction. They saw monasteries re-erected, laws of
mediæval severity made against blasphemy and the desecration of churches
and saints&rsquo; days, and the doctrine of the divine origin of the monarchy proclaimed
anew. &ldquo;And when young men spoke of glory,&rdquo; says de Musset,
&ldquo;the answer was, &lsquo;Become priests!&rsquo; And when they spoke of honour,
the answer was, &lsquo;Become priests!&rsquo; And when they spoke of hope, of
love, of strength and life, ever the same answer, &lsquo;Become priests!&rsquo;&rdquo; The
only result of this pressure was to intensify all the more the impulse towards
freedom. The political and intellectual reaction could only have the effect
of impelling the poetic and artistic emotions of young and unquiet spirits
into opposition, on principle, to all that was established, into a fiery contempt
for public opinion, into the apotheosis of unrestrained passion and unfettered
genius. The French Romanticists were anti-Philistines who regarded the
word &ldquo;bourgeois&rdquo; as an insult. For them Art was the one supreme consideration;
it was to them a light and a flame, and its beauty and daring the
only things worth living for. For those who put forward such demands as
these, the &ldquo;eunuchism of the Classical&rdquo;&mdash;an expression of George Sand&rsquo;s&mdash;could
never suffice. They dreamed of an art of painting which should find
its expression in blood, purple, light, movement, and boldness; they held in
sovereign contempt the correct, pedantic, colourless tendency of their elders.
An inner flame should glow through and liberate the forms, absorb the lines
and contours, and mould the picture into a symphony of colour. What was
desired and sought for, in poetry and in music, in plastic art and in painting,
was colour and passion: colour so energetic, that drawing was, as it were,
consumed by it; passion so vehement, that lyrical poetry and the drama
were in danger of becoming feverish and convulsive. A movement which
reminds one of the Renaissance took possession of all minds. It was as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page220" id="page220"></a>220</span>
though there were something intoxicating in the very air that one breathed.
On a political background of grey upon grey, consisting of the cowls of the
Jesuits of the Restoration, there arose a flaming, refulgent, blustering literature
and art, scintillating with sparks and bright hues, full of the adoration of
passion and of fervid colour. Romanticism is Protestantism in literature and
art&mdash;such is Vitet&rsquo;s definition of the movement.</p>

<p>Literature, which, adapting itself to the politics of the government, had
begun in Chateaubriand with an enthusiastic fervour for Catholicism, Monarchy,
and Mediævalism, had in the twenties become revolutionary; and
the description of its battles is one of the most glowing chapters in George
Brandes&rsquo; classic work. There was a revolt against the pseudo-antique, against
the stiff handling of the Alexandrine metre, against the yoke of tradition.
Then arose that mighty race of Romantic poets who proclaimed with Byronic
fire the gospel of nature and passion. De Musset, the famous child of the
century, the idol of the young generation, the poet with the burning heart,
who rushed through life with such eagerness and haste that at the age of
forty he broke down altogether, worn out like a man of seventy, deliberately
wrote bad rhymes in his first poems, for the purpose of thoroughly infuriating
the Classicists. So, too, he wrote his dramas, in which love is glorified as a
serious and terrible power with which one may not trifle, as the fire with
which one must not play, as the electric spark that kills. So George Sand,
the female Titan of Romanticism, published her novels, with their subversive
tendencies and their sparkling animation of narrative. Between these two
rises the keen bronze-like profile of Prosper Mérimée, who prefers to describe
the life of gypsies and robbers, and to depict the most violent and desperate
characters in history. Finally, Victor Hugo, the great chieftain of the
Romantic school, the Paganini of literature, unrivalled in imposing grandeur,
in masterly treatment of language, and in petty vanity, found submissive
multitudes to listen to him when he rose in fierce and fiery insurrection against
the rigid laws of the bloodless Classical style, and substituted for the actionless
and ill-contrived declamatory tragedies of his time his own romantic dramas,
breathing passion and full of diversified movement.</p>

<p>The conflict was deadly. The young generation hailed with applause
the new Messiah of letters, and grew intoxicated with the harmony of Hugo&rsquo;s
phrases, which sounded so much fuller and fierier than the measured speech
of Corneille and Racine. The Théâtre Français, recently benumbed as with
the quiet of the grave, became all at once a tumultuous battlefield. There
they sat, when Hugo&rsquo;s <i>Cromwell</i> and <i>Hernani</i> were produced on the stage,
correct, well dressed, gloved, close shaven, with their neat ties and shirt collars,
the representatives of the old generation, whose blameless conduct had raised
them to office and place. And in contrast to them, in the pit were crowded
together the young men, the &ldquo;Jeune France,&rdquo; as Théophile Gautier described
them, one with his waving hair like a lion&rsquo;s mane, another with his Rubens
hat and Spanish mantle, another in his vest of bright red satin. Their common
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page221" id="page221"></a>221</span>
uniform was the red waistcoat
introduced by Théophile Gautier&mdash;not
the red chosen for their
symbol by the men of the Revolution,
but the scarlet-red which
represented the hatred felt by these
enthusiastic young men for all
that was grey and dull, and their
preference for all that is luminous
and magnificently coloured in life.
They held that the contemplation
of a beautiful piece of red cloth
was an artistic pleasure. A similar
change took place at the same time
in ladies&rsquo; toilettes. As the Revolution
had in ladies&rsquo; costumes rejected
all colour in favour of the Grecian
white, so now dresses once more
assumed vivid, and especially deep
red hues; deep red ribbons adorned
the hat and encircled the waist.</p>

<p>Deep red&mdash;that was the colour of the Romantic school; the flourishing
of trumpets and the blare of brass its note. Flashes of passion and ferocity,
rivers of sulphur, showers of fire, glowing deserts, decaying corpses in horrible
phosphorescence, seas at night-time in which ships are sinking, landscapes
over which roaring War shakes his brand, and where maddened nations fall
furiously upon one another&mdash;such are the subjects, resonant with shout of
battle and song of victory, which held sway over French Romanticism. At
the very time when at Düsseldorf the young artists of Germany were
painting with the milk of pious feeling their lachrymose, susceptible, sentimental
pictures, utterly tame and respectable; when the Nazarene school
were holding their post-mortem on the livid corpse of old Italian art, and
seeking to galvanise it, and with it the Christian piety of the Middle Ages,
into life again; at that very time there arose in France a young generation
boiling over with fervour, who had for their rallying cry Nature and Truth,
but demanded at the same time, and before all else, contrast, pictorial antithesis,
and passion at once lofty and of tiger-like ferocity. In those very
years, when in Germany, the cartoon style of Carstens having died away,
progress was limited to a timid and unsuccessful pursuit of that revelry of
colour which marked the Quattrocentisti, the French took at once, as with
the seven-leagued boots of the fairy-tale, the great stride onward towards the
Flemings.</p>

<p>Through Napoleon, France had grown richer, not only in glory, but in art
treasures, gathered together from all countries into Paris, as trophies of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page222" id="page222"></a>222</span>
the victorious general. The
abundant collections thus
accumulated brought to bear
upon that generation the
quickening influence of the
best that had been done in
the art of painting. Nowhere
could one study either the
Venetian colourists or Rubens
to greater advantage than in
the Louvre, and it was by
virtue of this unrestrained
intercourse with the masters
who represent the most perfect
blossom of colouring that
the Byronic spirits of 1830
succeeded in giving full expression
to the glowing full-coloured
life of things which
hovered before their heated
imagination. It is unnecessary
to say that this was
accompanied by a great
widening of the range of
subjects treated. The Romantic
school showed that
there were other heroes in
history and poetry besides the Greeks and Romans. They painted everything,
if only it possessed colour and character, flame, passion, and exotic perfume.
Romanticism was the protest of painting against the plastic in art, the protest
of liberty against the academic teaching of the Classical school, the revolution
of movement against stiffness.</p>

<p>It was in the studio of Guérin, the tame and timid Classicist, that the
young assailants grew up, &ldquo;the daubers of 1830,&rdquo; who called the Apollo
Belvidere a shabby yellow turnip, and who spoke of Racine and Raphael as
of street arabs. They were tired of copying profiles of Antinous. The contemplation
of a picture by Girodet was wearisome to them. It was <i>Théodore
Géricault</i>, a hot, hasty passionate nature, of Beethoven-like unruliness and
of heaven-storming boldness, who spoke the word of deliverance.</p>

<p>He was a Norman, sturdily built and serious in manner. Even while he
was studying in Guérin&rsquo;s studio he had already grasped some of the ideas
which Gros had in his mind, and, although not his pupil, Géricault may be
said to have continued his work, or at least would have been able to do so had
he lived longer. Like him, he had from his youth up contemplated, full of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page223" id="page223"></a>223</span>
wonder, the rolling sea and
the thunder-laden skies; like
him, he had a predilection
for fine horses; and, being
of a somewhat melancholy
disposition, he preferred to
treat of the darker aspects
of life. His aspiration was
to paint the surging sea,
proud steeds rushing past at
a gallop, suffering and striving
humanity, great deeds,
pathos and frenzy in every
form. His first works were
splendid horsemen, whose
every muscle twitches with
nervous movement. During
his short stay in Charles
Vernet&rsquo;s studio he had already
taken an interest in
cavalry, and begun the
studies of such subjects,
which he continued to the
day of his death. Afterwards,
while he was working
under Guérin and before his
visit to Italy in 1817, he
often went to the Louvre, copied pictures and studied Rubens, to the great
annoyance of his teacher, who with horror beheld him entering upon so
perilous a path.</p>

<p>Here again he followed in the steps of Gros, whose portrait of General
Fournier Sarlovése was hung in the Salon of 1812 close by Géricault&rsquo;s &ldquo;Mounted
Officer.&rdquo; This picture, a portrait of M. Dieudonné, an officer in the Chasseurs
d&rsquo;Afrique, crossing the battlefield sword in hand on a rearing horse, was
the first work exhibited by Géricault, then twenty-one years of age. It was
an event. Gros found himself supported, if not surpassed, by a beginner who
had his own enthusiasm for colour and movement, for profiles broadly and
boldly delineated. In 1814 followed the &ldquo;Wounded Cuirassier,&rdquo; staggering
across the field of battle and dragging his horse behind him. These were
no longer warriors seated on classical steeds foaming with rage, but real
soldiers in whom there was nothing of the Greek statue. Then Géricault
went to Italy, but in this case also it was not to pursue archæological studies in
the museums, but to see the race of the <i>barberi</i> during carnival. To this
time belong those studies of horses, for the possession of which collectors vie
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page224" id="page224"></a>224</span>
with one another to-day, sketches made in the open air, out in the street or
in the stables. &ldquo;The Horses at the Manger&rdquo; and &ldquo;Horses fighting&rdquo; were
among the pearls of the collection of French drawings in the Paris Exhibition
of 1889.</p>

<p>In 1819 he completed his greatest picture, that which most people alone
call to mind&mdash;not quite fairly&mdash;when his name is mentioned&mdash;&ldquo;The Raft
of the Medusa.&rdquo; What a tragedy is there represented! For twelve days
the unfortunate wretches have been on the deep, starving, in utter despair
and ready to lift their hands against each other. They were a hundred and
fifty, now they are but fifteen. One old man holds upon his knees the corpse
of his son; another tears his hair out, left alone in life after seeing all his dear
ones perish. In the foreground lie dead bodies which the waves have not yet
swept away. But far away in the distance a sail appears. One points it out
to another: yes, it is a sail! A mariner and a negro mount upon an empty
barrel and wave their handkerchiefs in the air. Will they be seen? The
anxiety is terrible. And ever higher and higher the grey waves roll on.</p>

<p>How must such a scene have impressed a generation which for long years
had seen nothing in the Salon but dry mythology and painted statues! Géricault
was the first to free himself from the tyranny of the plaster-of-Paris bust,
and once again to put passion and truth to nature in the place of cold marble.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page225" id="page225"></a>225</span>
Just as he commissioned the ship&rsquo;s carpenter who had constructed the raft
and was one of the saved to make him a model of it, so also he moved into a
studio close to the hospital, for the purpose of studying the sick and dying, of
sketching dead bodies and single limbs. It must be admitted that one would
wish for a yet firmer grasp of the subject. In form, Géricault still belongs to
the school of David. A good deal of Classicism shows itself in the fact that
he thought it necessary to depict the majority of the figures naked, in order
to avoid &ldquo;unpictorial&rdquo; costumes. There is still something academic in the
figures, which do not seem to be sufficiently weakened by privation, disease,
and the struggle with death; but what man can free himself at one stroke
from the influence of his time and environment? Even in the colouring
there lingers some touch of the Classical school. It offends no one, a fact to
be insisted on in comparing him with the Nazarenes; but as yet it plays no
part in expressing the meaning of the picture. From the distance, indeed,
whence the rescuing ship is drawing near, a bright light shines forth upon
a scene otherwise depicted in dull brown. Save for this, the intention of the
picture is not expressed by means of colour, and it even shows some retrogression
as compared with Géricault&rsquo;s earlier works. He had begun with
Rubens, yet these studies in colouring did not last. In the &ldquo;Wounded
Cuirassier&rdquo; of 1814 dark tones took the place of the former cheerfulness, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page226" id="page226"></a>226</span>
so in the &ldquo;Raft of the Medusa&rdquo; he imagined
the tragedy could be represented only in sombre
hues. He spread over the whole scene a monotonous
unpleasant brown shade, and in his
endeavour to lay all weight upon human
emotion he went so far as almost to suppress
the sea, which nevertheless played the chief
part in the drama, and whose deep blue would
have afforded a splendid contrast. Discoveries
are not to be made all at once, but only when
their hour is come.</p>

<p>The next step in French art was to be that
of reinstating the significance of colour in the
full rights conquered for it by Titian, so that
it should no longer be merely a tasteful tinting
of the figures, but should become truly that
which gives its temper to the picture. It
was not reserved for Géricault to effect this. A trip to London, which he
made in 1820, in company with his friend Charlet, was the last event of
his life. There the sportsman awoke in him once more, and he painted the
&ldquo;Race for the Derby at Epsom.&rdquo; Soon after his return he was thrown from
his horse while riding, but lingered on for two years longer, suffering from a
spinal complaint. With a few more years in which to develop he should
have been one of the great masters of France, but he died when scarcely in
his thirty-second year.</p>

<p>Yet he lived long enough to observe, in the Salon of 1822, the début of
one of his comrades from Guérin&rsquo;s studio. A greater than himself, to whom
with dying voice he had given a few words of advice, arose as the intellectual
heir of the young painter so prematurely carried off, and carried to its issue the
struggle which he had begun. It was on 26th April 1799, at midday, that
the first genuine painter&rsquo;s eye of the century saw the light, at Charenton Saint-Maurice.
Géricault had made a beginning, but it was the impetuous, powerful
genius of <i>Eugène Delacroix</i> which entered in and completed his work. What
Gros had dimly perceived, but had not dared to express, what Géricault had
barely had time with a courageous hand to point out, a hand too soon stiffened
in death&mdash;the modern poetry of colour, of fever, and of quivering emotion&mdash;it
was reserved for Delacroix to write.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That child will grow up to be a famous man; his life will be extremely
laborious, but also extremely agitated, and always exposed to opposition.&rdquo;
Thus had a madman prophesied of the boy one day when he and his nurse
were taking a walk near the lunatic asylum at Charenton. And he was
right.</p>

<p>Delacroix was another of the pupils who had grown up in Guérin&rsquo;s studio,
but he became the latter&rsquo;s antipode. Even in his student years he took
counsel, not of the antique, but of Rubens and Veronese; and when Géricault
was painting his &ldquo;Raft of the Medusa,&rdquo; Delacroix belonged to the little band
of enthusiastic admirers which gathered round the young master. He served
as model for the half-submerged man to the left in the foreground of that
picture. After busying himself at first almost entirely with caricatures, and
studies of horses, and with Madonnas in the Classical style, he exhibited in
1822 his &ldquo;Dante&rsquo;s Bark,&rdquo; in a pictorial sense the first characteristic picture of
the century. One is inclined even to-day to repeat David&rsquo;s exclamation when
he caught sight of the work, the first great epoch-making life-utterance of the
revolutionary Romanticists: &ldquo;<i>D&rsquo;où vient-il? Je ne connais pas cette touche-la.</i>&rdquo;
There were thoughts in it which had not been conceived and expressed in
the same manner since the time of Tintoretto. Dante and Virgil, ferried by
Phlegyas over Acheron, are passing among the souls of the damned, who
grasp hold of the boat with the energy of despair. A theme taken from a
mediæval author; an antique figure, that of Virgil, but seen through the
prism of modern poetry. While the Florentine, stiff with horror, gazes upon
the swimming figures which cling to the boat with teeth and nails, Virgil,
tranquil and serious, turns on them a face which the emotions of life can no
longer affect.</p>

<p>The work obtained a decisive success. A carpenter in Delacroix&rsquo;s house
had made for the young painter an inartistic frame of four boards. When
he went to the exhibition and looked for his picture in the side-rooms he
could not find it. The frame had fallen to pieces during removal, but the
picture had been hung in an honourable place in the Louvre, in a rich frame
ordered for it by Baron Gros. &ldquo;You must learn drawing, my young friend,
and then you will become a second Rubens,&rdquo; was the salute which this remarkable
man, whose theory ever gave the lie to his practice, gave the young
master. Naturally Delacroix would not now have been admitted into the
school of David, or would have been placed there in the lowest rank&mdash;with
Rubens and a few other immortals, who drew no better than he did. He was
absolutely opposed to all the exact, regular, well-balanced, colourless traditions
which held sway in David&rsquo;s school with their pedantic erudition and <i>bourgeois</i>
discretion. The principle of the Classicists was the Greek type of beauty, and
the translation of sculpture into painting. In Delacroix&rsquo;s picture there was
no longer anything of that sort. Géricault had already broken away from
the academic stencilling of form, and had substituted natural expression, life,
and emotion for conventional types; Delacroix now set aside the sullen colouring
of the Classical school, and its painted statues made way for the colour-symphonies
of the Venetians.</p>

<table class="flt" style="float: right; width: 460px;" summary="Illustration">

<p>These reforming qualities found in his second work, a few years later, a
much fuller expression than in the &ldquo;Dante&rsquo;s Bark.&rdquo; At that time the Greeks,
that heroic nation, struggling and dying for its religion and independence,
had excited everywhere the deepest sympathy and enthusiasm. Delacroix
was the very man to be inspired by such a theme. From the agitation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page230" id="page230"></a>230</span>
caused by the martyrdom of Greece, and from his taste for Byron&rsquo;s poetry,
resulted in 1824 the celebrated &ldquo;Massacre of Chios,&rdquo; on which he was already
employed in 1821, before the completion of his &ldquo;Dante&rsquo;s Bark,&rdquo; and in which
his power of expression as well as of colour was carried much further than in
the earlier picture. In the &ldquo;Dante&rsquo;s Bark&rdquo; there were still, both in form
and colour, reminiscences of the great Florentine masters; as, for instance,
in the female figure in the foreground, which is almost an exact reproduction
of Michael Angelo&rsquo;s &ldquo;Night.&rdquo; The event depicted was comparatively quiet
and tranquil, and the well-balanced composition would have done honour to
the most rigorous follower of David. The only novelty lay in the treatment of
colour, and in the substitution of the individual and characteristic for the
typical and ideal. But undoubtedly it was now possible not only to produce
in colour more powerful chords, but also in expression to strike notes more
dramatic, for the academic plaster-of-Paris heads of the David school had
depicted human emotion only in icy immobility. Delacroix had put all these
possibilities into the new picture. The pyramidal configuration has resolved
itself into an unconstrained grouping of figures. Here we have for the first
time the artistic spirit intoxicated with colour, the &ldquo;Orlando Furioso of
colourists,&rdquo; the pupil of Rubens, Delacroix. An entire world of deep feeling
and of painfully passionate
poetry, an entire world of
tones, which the master
under whose eyes he painted
his &ldquo;Dante&rdquo; could not have
conceived, lies enclosed within
the frame of this picture.
The figures, sitting, kneeling,
partly reclining, with their
half-starved bodies and their
gloomy, brooding, hopeless
faces; the desperate struggle
between the conquerors and
their victims in the far distance;
the contrast between
this scene of horror and the
luminous splendour of the
atmosphere, and the wealth
of colour in the whole, made
and still make this fine painting
one of the most impressive
pictures in the Louvre.
It is a work which flames in
glow of colour more than
any that had appeared in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page231" id="page231"></a>231</span>
France since the days of Rubens. The English had been his teachers. &ldquo;It
is here only that colour and effect are understood and felt,&rdquo; Géricault had
previously written from London. Delacroix&rsquo;s work had already been sent
off to the Salon when Constable&rsquo;s first pictures were just arriving there, and
the impression which they made upon him was so powerful that, at the very
last moment, and in the Louvre itself, he gave his picture a brighter and more
luminous colouring.</p>

<p>And indeed it was not till now that the Classicists perceived how great
an opponent had arisen against them. Not only did the aged Gros call the
&ldquo;Massacre of Chios&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>le massacre de la peinture</i>,&rdquo; but all the critics talked
about barbarism, and prophesied that on this path French painting would
hasten to its destruction. The prize of the Salon was awarded, not to the
&ldquo;Massacre,&rdquo; but to Sigalon&rsquo;s &ldquo;Locusta,&rdquo; an unimportant work of compromise,
though very clever and well studied in draughtsmanship. It was
said that Delacroix&rsquo;s picture was lacking in symmetrical arrangement, that
he showed too great a contempt for the beautiful, that indeed he appeared
systematically to prefer the ugly&mdash;that is to say, he was blamed for the very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page232" id="page232"></a>232</span>
qualities wherein lay his importance as a reformer. Accustomed as they had
been for many years to an art in which intellect, correctness, and moderation
held sway, not one of the critics was in a position to perceive all at once the
value of this fiery spirit. Delécluze, the indefatigable defender of the sacred
dogmas of the Classical school, characterised &ldquo;dramatic expression and composition
marked by action&rdquo; as the reef whereon the grand style of painting
must inevitably be wrecked. The modern schools of art, he taught as late as
1824, exist, flourish, and have their being only by the utilisation of what we
can learn from the Greeks. Even acknowledging the progress in colour which
the work showed, it nevertheless belonged, he said, to an inferior genus, and
all its excellences in colouring could not outweigh the ugliness of its form.</p>

<p>Therewith began the battles of the Romantic school, and all the daring of
Théophile Gautier, Thiers, Victor Hugo, Sainte-Beuve, Baudelaire, Bürger-Thoré,
Gustave Planche, Paul Mantz, and others had to be called upon in
order to storm the heights held by the batteries of the Classical critics. Count
Forbin gave proof of no less courage when he bought the picture, torn to
shreds as it was by hostile criticism, for the State, at the price of six thousand
francs. This enabled Delacroix to visit England. He spent the time from
spring to autumn of 1825 in London, where he consorted amicably with all the
artists of the day. And he took an interest not only in English art, but also
in literature and the drama. His preference for Shakespeare, Byron, and
Walter Scott, who were already his favourite poets, found new sustenance.
An English opera made him acquainted with Goethe&rsquo;s <i>Faust</i>; and henceforth
these poets entered into the foreground of his works. A picture of &ldquo;Tasso&rdquo;
(the poet in a cell of the madhouse, through the window of which two grinning
lunatics look in upon him) in 1826, the &ldquo;Execution of the Doge Marino
Faliero&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Death of Sardanapalus,&rdquo; both after Byron, in 1827, and
&ldquo;Faust in his Study&rdquo; in 1828, followed the &ldquo;Massacre&rdquo;&mdash;all of them obviously
the works of a painter who loved bright, glowing colour, had studied Rubens
and had recently returned from England. In 1828 was published, in seventeen
plates, his cycle of illustrations to <i>Faust</i>, to accompany a translation of the
poem into French; and this was followed by a number of lithographs on
Shakespearian subjects.</p>

<p>And here we may notice a singular exchange of parts. When the word
&ldquo;Romantic&rdquo; was first heard in Germany it had originally much the same
sense as &ldquo;Roman.&rdquo; The German Romanticists were moved to enthusiasm
by Roman Catholicism and Roman church painting. But when Romanticism
reached France, the word came to mean exactly the opposite: a preference
for the German and English spirit as compared with the Greek and Latin, and
an enthusiasm for the great Anglo-Saxon and German poets, Shakespeare and
Goethe, in whom, contrasting with Racine&rsquo;s correctness, were to be found
unrestrained genius and glowing passion. This influence of poetry over art
may easily become dangerous, if painters sponge, so to speak, upon the poet,
as the Düsseldorf school did, and make use of his work only for the purpose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page233" id="page233"></a>233</span>
of enabling works, in themselves valueless, to keep their heads, artistically
speaking, above water, by means of their extrinsic poetical interest. But
Delacroix had no need of any such support. He was not the poets&rsquo; pupil, but
their brother. He did not study them in order to illustrate their works, but
was imbued with their spirit and possessed by their souls. He lived with them;
he did not borrow his subjects from them, but rather made use of them to
express in his own powerful language the strongest emotions of the human
heart. Nor did he ever forget that painting must, before all, be painting.
Endowed as he was with a poet&rsquo;s soul, he conceived things as a painter, not
laboriously translating passages from the poets, but simply thinking in colour.
What the musician hears, what the poet imagines, he saw. The scenes of
which he read appeared at once before his eyes as sketches, in great masses of
colour. For him, composition, action, and colour ever united together into
one inseparable whole.</p>

<p>The journey to Morocco, which he made in the spring of 1832, in
company with an embassy sent by Louis Philippe to the Emperor Muley
Abderrahman, is noteworthy for a further progress in his ability as
a colourist and a new broadening of his range of subjects. When
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page234" id="page234"></a>234</span>
he returned to the port of Toulon, on 5th July 1832, he had seen
Algiers and Spain, and had assimilated an abundance of sunshine and
colour. It is in his Oriental pictures that his painting first reaches its
zenith, just as Victor Hugo&rsquo;s mastery over language was at its highest
point in his <i>Orientales</i>. Goethe, in his <i>West-östliches Divan</i>, celebrated
what is quiet and contemplative in the Oriental view of life. Obermann
sang of the land of legend, of buried treasures, of Aladdin and the wonderful
lamp; but for Byron (who was practically the first to introduce into
Europe the perfume and colour of the East), for Hugo, and for Delacroix,
it was the distant, bright-hued, barbaric land of the rising sun, the land of
sanguinary warfare and overthrow, the home of light and colour. Here it was
that the French Romanticists found the world that realised their dreams of
colour. The East became for them what Rome had been for the Classical
school. From the feeble and misty sun of Paris, and from the grey skies of
the Boulevard des Italiens, they turned to Africa.</p>

<p>His enthusiasm for this newly discovered world resounds, full and clear,
in Delacroix&rsquo;s letters. &ldquo;Were I to leave the land in which I have found
them,&rdquo; he wrote, during his stay in Morocco, of the men whom he saw about
him there, &ldquo;they would seem to me like trees torn up by the roots. I should
forget the impressions I have received, and should be able only in an incomplete
and frigid manner to reproduce the sublime and fascinating life which
fills the streets here, and attracts one by the beauty of its appearance. Think,
my friend, what it means to a painter to see lying in the sunshine, wandering
about the streets and offering shoes for sale, men who have the appearance
of ancient consuls, of the reincarnated spirits of Cato and Brutus, who lack
not even that proud, discontented look which those lords of the world must
have had. They possess nothing save a blanket in which they walk, sleep,
and are buried, and yet they look as dignified as Cicero in his curule chair.
What truth, what nobility in these figures! There is nothing more beautiful
in the antique. And all in white, as with Roman senators or at the Greek
Panathenæa.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His palette was thus further enriched in lucid tints, the contrasts he
formerly delighted in became less sharp and glaring, the gloomy background
hitherto preferred was superseded by a bright serenity and a golden lustre.
The colour-effect of his &ldquo;Algerian Women&rdquo; has been not unaptly compared
to the impression produced by a glance into an open jewel casket. In his
&ldquo;Convulsionaries of Tangier&rdquo; he has depicted with wild, demoniac energy
the religious frenzy of a Turkish sect. Green, blue, red, and violet hues unite
to produce an effect as of a sounding flourish of trumpets, recalling the music
of the janizaries. The &ldquo;Entry of the Crusaders into Constantinople&rdquo; resembles
an old delicately tinted carpet, full of powerful, tranquil harmony.
Even in his old age he wrote: &ldquo;The aspect of that country will be for ever
before my eyes; the types of that vigorous race will move in my memory as
long as I live; in them I truly found the antique beauty again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The contemplation of such scenes induced Delacroix to undertake the
representation of antique subjects, which he had hitherto avoided, not because
he disliked the antique, but because of the aversion he felt for David&rsquo;s treatment
of it. During his sojourn in Africa he had come to the conclusion
that the painting of scenes from ancient history should not be based upon
the imitation of statues and bas-reliefs, as with David and his pupils; but
that it should be imbued with the movement and passion of modern life, since
the ancient Greeks were men of flesh and blood like ourselves. Therefore it
is that he snatches the marble mask from the faces of David&rsquo;s puppets.
Flemish blood begins to move in the Greek statues, Flemish passion to break
through their inflexible rhythm. Paintings such as the &ldquo;Justice of Trajan&rdquo;
of 1840 represent the antique in a thoroughly personal and modern paraphrase,
just as Shakespeare or Byron had seen it. The mad &ldquo;Medea&rdquo; is, from the
point of view of colour, certainly the chief work of this group.</p>

<p>It was of course impossible that a man so highly endowed with emotional
pathos should pass untouched the tragedy of the life of Christ and the sufferings
of the Christian martyrs. By the Revolution religious themes had
been absolutely excluded from representation, and up to this time the young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page236" id="page236"></a>236</span>
innovators of the Restoration period had also felt an aversion for them.
Their ideas were as little attuned to Catholic as to academic tradition. Delacroix
was the first to treat once more of biblical subjects, so far as they are
imbued with dramatic and passionate movement. Like Rubens, he regarded
the lives of the saints, the story of the Gospels, and the tragedy on Golgotha
as a poetical narrative like any other. His Mary, like that of the Flemish
painters, is a sorrowing woman, the embodiment of unending grief.</p>

<p>Alongside of these easel pictures he produced, during a period of more
than twenty-five years, a long list of monumental and decorative works;
and they too were the most inventive, the boldest, and the most original
which monumental painting produced during this epoch, not in France only,
but in Europe. In this sphere also, where, under the pressure of old traditions
and conventional types, it is so difficult to avoid plagiarism, Delacroix maintained
his individuality. In 1835, at the suggestion of his friend Thiers,
he was commissioned to paint the interior of the Chamber of Deputies in the
Palais Bourbon&mdash;the most important commission which had fallen to the lot
of any French artist since Gros painted the cupola of the Pantheon. Not
long afterwards he decorated with verve and enthusiasm the ceiling of the
Louvre, choosing for his subject the &ldquo;Triumph of Apollo.&rdquo; In the Library
of the Luxembourg he had recourse to the <i>Divina Commedia</i>, and treated
in a masterly manner the theme so familiar and sympathetic to him. In his
works there is something of the joyous and sportive energy of Rubens&rsquo; allegorical
pictures, but not the least trace of imitation. He understood decorative
painting in the sense of the great old masters, Giulio Romano and Veronese,
not as wall didactics and lectures on archæology; he knew that descriptive
prose has nothing whatever to do with the walls of a building, but that the sole
aim of such paintings is to fill the house with their solemn grandeur, to make
the whole building resound as it were with sacred organ music. Between
1853 and 1861 came also the wall paintings in the Church of Saint Sulpice,
and one would almost think that Delacroix finished them in feverish excitement,
to show for the last time how enormous a store of passion and power
still lay in the soul of a sexagenarian. Shortly after their completion, on
13th August 1863, he died, who was, in the words of Silvestre, &ldquo;the painter
of the genuine race, who had the sun in his head and a thunderstorm in his
heart, who in the course of forty years sounded the entire gamut of human
emotion, and whose grandiose and awe-inspiring brush passed from saints to
warriors, from warriors to lovers, from lovers to tigers, from tigers to flowers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In these words Delacroix is very aptly characterised. His range of subjects
included everything: decorative, historical, and religious painting, landscape,
flowers, animals, sea pieces, classical antiquity and the Middle Ages, the
scorching heat of the south and the mists of the north. He left no branch
of the art of painting untouched; nothing escaped his lion&rsquo;s claws. But
there is one bond uniting all: to all the figures for which he won the citizenship
of art he gave passion and movement. His predominant quality is a passion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page237" id="page237"></a>237</span>
for the terrible, a kind of insatiability for wild and violent action. His over-excited
imagination heaps pain, horror, and pathos one upon another. The
critics called him &ldquo;the tattooed savage who paints with a drunken broom.&rdquo;
There is nothing pretty or lovable about his art; it is a wild art. He depicted
passion wherever he found it, in the shape of wild animals, stormy seas, or
battling warriors; and he sought it in every sphere, in nature no less than
in poetry and the Bible. Hardly any painter&mdash;not even Rubens&mdash;has
depicted with equal power the passions and movements of animals: lions in
which he is own brother to Barye; fighting horses, in which he stands side by
side with Géricault. No other artist painted waves more grand, wind-beaten,
foaming, dashing, towering on high. Looking at them, one divines all the
horrors concealed beneath the roar of the blue surface, horrors which were as
yet so insufficiently suggested in Géricault&rsquo;s &ldquo;Raft of the Medusa.&rdquo; In his
historical pictures there reigns now terror and despair, as in the &ldquo;Massacre
of Chios&rdquo;; now gloomy horror, as in the &ldquo;Medea&rdquo;; now feverish movement,
as in the &ldquo;Death of the Bishop of Liège.&rdquo; He passes from Dante
to Shakespeare, from Goethe to Byron, but only to borrow from them their
most moving dramatic situations&mdash;Hamlet at Yorick&rsquo;s grave, his fight with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page238" id="page238"></a>238</span>
Laertes, Macbeth and the Witches,
Lady Macbeth, Gretchen, Angelica,
the Prisoner of Chillon, the Giaour,
and the Pasha. All time is his
domain, all countries are open to
him; he hurries through the broad
fields of imagination, a lordly reaper
of all harvests.</p>

<p>And at the same time, in all his
great human tragedies, he compels
the elements to obey him as if they
were his slaves. The passions of
men set heaven and earth in motion.
The agonising cries of victims find in
his paintings an echo in the sullen
shadows and the leaden, heavy clouds
of the sky. The gloomy shores
which Dante&rsquo;s boat is approaching
are as desolate as the spirits who
wander through the night. But
where splendour and glory reign, as
in the &ldquo;Entry of the Crusaders into
Constantinople,&rdquo; the air, too, glistens
and shines as though saturated with
dust of gold. In his pictures a
human soul which was great and full
of meaning, and which possessed such combustibility that it took fire of itself,
expressed itself recklessly, with the volcanic strength of an elemental power.</p>

<p>This proud self-reliance explains also how it was that this painter of unruly
genius was, as a man, very far from being a revolutionist. For Delacroix
the outer world had no existence; that world alone existed which was within
him. After his picture of &ldquo;The Barricades&rdquo; in 1831 he avoided all political
allusions, painted, read, and led a tranquil, measured, uniform life. In
society polite and reserved, of aristocratic coldness, gentlemanly in appearance,
and well-bred; in his speech curt, mordant, emphatic, and occasionally
witty, he could nevertheless show himself, when he chose, an amiable, original
talker, full of piquant ideas. Moreover, he was a great writer and critic, whose
essays in the <i>Revue des Deux Mondes</i> have the perfect classic stamp. Nevertheless,
he was always displeased when any one put him forward as the chief
of official Romanticism, and saluted him as the Victor Hugo of painting.
Surrounded as he was by young assailants of tradition who would allow no
merit to anything old, he found pleasure in acknowledging his admiration
for Racine, whom he knew by heart, and whom, when need was, he defended
against the younger generation. He was too diplomatic to stir up against
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page239" id="page239"></a>239</span>
himself unnecessarily the hatred of those whom the long-haired Samsons of
Romanticism called Philistines.</p>

<p>So far as in him lay, his quiet and methodical life should suffer no interruption.
Worshipper though he was of light and colour, he was almost always
shut up in his gloomy studio, and it was only when he found himself brush in
hand that the reserved man became the passionate, vibrating painter. Then
the memories with which his study of the poets had stored his mind grew in
his fantasy into grand pictures glowing with life. By these visions he was
excited, set on fire, and filled with enthusiasm. His studio was open but to
few, for the intrusion of visitors chilled his inspiration, and he found it difficult
to recover the proper frame of mind. Not till evening did he take his first
meal, for he thought he could work with greater intensity when hungry.
During a period of forty years he lived in his various studios, quiet and
solitary, inventing, drawing, and painting without intermission, his door
always bolted, so that when it suited him he could give out that he was ill of
a fever. Every morning before work he drew an arm, a hand, or a piece of
drapery after Rubens. He had formed the habit of taking Rubens to himself
when other people were drinking
their coffee.</p>

<p>Indeed, when one speaks of
Delacroix, the name of Rubens
rises almost involuntarily to
one&rsquo;s lips; and yet there is a
profound difference between
him and the great Flemish
master. Rubens has the same
passion, the same ever-active
fancy; yet all his pictures rest
in triumphant repose, while
every one of Delacroix&rsquo;s seems
to resound as with a cry of
battle. Looking at Rubens&rsquo;
works you feel that he was a
happy, healthy man; but by
the time you have seen half a
score of Delacroix&rsquo;s it is borne
in upon you that the life of the
artist was one of strife and
suffering. Rubens was the very
essence of strength, Delacroix
was a sick man; the former full
of fleshly joyous sensuality, the
latter consumed by a feverish
internal fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page240" id="page240"></a>240</span></p>

<p>His portrait of himself in the Louvre, with its pale forehead, its large dark-rimmed
eyes, its lean, hollow face, its parchment-like skin stretched tightly
over the bones, explains his pictures better than any critical appreciation.
Delacroix was one of the <i>âmes maladives</i>, the spirits sick unto death, to whom
Baudelaire addresses himself in his <i>Fleurs du Mal</i>. Delicate from his youth
up, thoroughly nervous by nature, he prolonged his sickly existence throughout
his life by sheer energy of will. Even in his childhood he passed through
serious illnesses, and later on he suffered in turn from his stomach, throat,
chest, and kidneys. Like Goethe in his old age, he felt well only when the
temperature was high. He was short in stature. A leonine head, with a
lion&rsquo;s mane, surmounted a body that seemed almost stunted. With his
eyes flashing like carbuncles, and his disordered prickly moustache, his was
the fascinating ugliness of genius.</p>

<p>It was only by the strictest dieting in his quiet retreat at Champrosay
that he prolonged his life for the last few years. In his youth he hovered
like a butterfly from flower to flower; when grown old and hypochondriacal
he withdrew into solitary retirement, work was the only medicine for diseased
conditions of all kinds, to which he found himself daily more and more a
victim. Only thus could this sickly man, doomed from his very birth, come
to produce no less than two thousand pictures&mdash;a number all the more astonishing
as Delacroix, even when his health permitted him to work at his easel,
by no means possessed Rubens&rsquo; sovereign facility of production. The
fever of work alternated, in his case, with the extremest exhaustion. There
was something morbid, nervous, over-excited in all he did. &ldquo;Even work,&rdquo;
he writes, &ldquo;is merely a temporary narcotic, a distraction; and every distraction,
as Pascal has said in other words, is only a method which man has
invented to conceal from himself the abyss of his suffering and misery. In
sleepless nights, in illness, and in certain moments of solitude, when the end
of all things discloses itself in its utter nakedness, a man endowed with
imagination must possess a certain amount of courage, not to meet the
phantom half-way, not to rush to embrace the skeleton.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The feverish disposition which he brought with him into the world was
heightened by the acrimonious feuds in which, as a painter, he was forced
to engage, and which left great bitterness behind them in his mind. His
life and his art were in accord, in as much as both were battles. It is not
easy to live when one is always ill; not easy to meet with recognition when
one proclaims the exact opposite of that which for a generation past all the
world has held to be true. And Delacroix took not a single step to meet
his opponents half-way. He did not trouble himself for a single moment
to please the public; and therefore the public did not come to him. Controversies
such as that which took place over the &ldquo;Massacre of Chios&rdquo; continued
decade after decade, and the exhibition of each of his pictures was
the signal for a battle. &ldquo;No work of his,&rdquo; writes Thoré, &ldquo;but called forth
deafening howls, curses, and furious controversy. Insults were heaped upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page241" id="page241"></a>241</span>
the artist, coarser and more opprobrious than one would be justified in applying
to a sharper.&rdquo; At Charenton, where he was born, is the Bedlam of France.
Hence the epithet continually hurled at him by the critics, who called him
the runaway from Charenton.</p>

<p>Until the year 1847 his pictures could without difficulty be excluded
from the Salon. He irritated people by his violence, by the abruptness
of his compositions, by his arrangement of figures with a view to pathos
at the expense of plastic elegance; he displeased by the incompleteness of
his works, which were regarded as sketches, not finished paintings. When
Louis Philippe ordered a picture from his brush, it was on the express condition
that it should be as little a Delacroix as possible. There was general
ill-humour among the academicians when, at Thiers&rsquo; suggestion, he was commissioned
to decorate the Palais Bourbon. And Delacroix, ambitious and
sensitive as he was, was deeply hurt by every mortification of this kind, and
affected by every gust of criticism as by a change of wind. Continually
denounced in the newspapers, attacked, wounded, delivered over to the
wild beasts, as he called it, he never had a moment of rest&mdash;he who, with
his irritable temperament and fragile health, needed rest more than any
man. It was not until almost all his works were brought together in the
Universal Exhibition of 1885 that it became evident how great an artist
this Delacroix was, whom his country for forty years had not understood,
and to whom the Institute had closed its doors to the last. Yet he
was no sooner dead than all with one voice proclaimed him a genius; his
smallest drawing is to-day worth its weight in gold, while during his lifetime
he seldom got more than two thousand francs for his largest paintings.
His sketches, great works in small frames, have for the most part found their
way to America. The sale of the pictures he left behind him produced three
hundred and sixty thousand francs.</p>

<p>Delacroix, therefore, was victorious, but not as Rubens was; and his
ceiling of the Louvre, with the &ldquo;Triumph of Apollo,&rdquo; one of his most remarkable
works, strikes one almost as an allegory of his own life. What especially
attracted and inspired the artist in this painting were the spasms and convulsions
of the misshapen monsters which the god expels from the earth&mdash;the
serpent twisting itself in movements of pain and fury, raising its head
on high, hissing rage, and vomiting venom and blood. The god himself,
who in the midst of a sea of light ascends into heaven in a golden chariot
drawn by radiant steeds, shows in his sturdy limbs and attitude ready for
defence, and in his wrathful face, no trace of the proud majesty and joyous
splendour which Greece connected with the name of Apollo. He is a mortal
who has fought and conquered, not a god who triumphs in tranquil power.
He is Delacroix, not Rubens; a Titan, not an Olympian god.</p>

<p>The artistic power in Delacroix could in no wise submit to the confinement
imposed by the French spirit of his time. It was not possible for a
single man, though endowed with the most splendid courage, to overthrow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page242" id="page242"></a>242</span>
in a moment all the traditions of French
art. Any one who knows the French must
feel that David&rsquo;s Latin style could not so
suddenly disappear out of their art, that it
was not possible at a blow to banish all
that had hitherto held sway and to replace
it by its opposite. Ever since Poussin they
had sought in Roman antiquity the formulæ
of their art. The predilection which the
Parisians have even to-day for the representation
of Racine&rsquo;s and Corneille&rsquo;s
tragedies, the admiration which even the
most extreme Naturalists bestow upon
Poussin and Lesueur, prove abundantly how
deep Classicism is rooted in the flesh and
blood of the French people. Brandes has
remarked, very acutely, that, strictly speaking,
even Romanticism was on French soil
in many respects a Classical phenomenon, a product of French Classical
rhetoric. &ldquo;They never saw the dances of the elves, never heard the delicate
harmony of their roundelays.&rdquo; In Victor Hugo, the great opponent of
Corneille, Corneille himself was re-embodied. He too is a draughtsman,
constructs his poems like architectural works, chisels the form, polishes the
verse, and confines his colouring within powerfully conceived Michelangelesque
outlines.</p>

<p>Once the first eager impulse of the Romantic school had subsided, these
old Classical tendencies showed themselves anew and with all the greater
vehemence. Even Hugo&rsquo;s dramas, with their predilection for all that is
exuberant and monstrous, with their overflowing lyricism and sonorous
pathos, became in the long run wearisome. He, who had hitherto been the
idol of the young generation, was now called the Pater Bombasticus of the
literature of the world.</p>

<p>Classicism found its poet and its muse. An unknown but very worthy
young man, not endowed with wealth of imagination, but imbued with the
most honourable intentions, came to Paris from the provincial town where
he had grown to manhood, with a manuscript in his pocket. And François
Ronsard&rsquo;s <i>Lucrèce</i>, a tragedy from the antique, in its style sober and severe,
reminding one of Racine, was represented amid thunders of applause, shortly
after Hugo had been hissed off the stage. Enthusiastic admirers saw in
it a glorious return to the great tragic drama of France, an emanation from
the spirit of Corneille, and praised its clear, measured, and at once &ldquo;classic
and familiar&rdquo; language. Together with its poet, the Classical reaction
found its actress. In 1838 a young untrained child made her début at the
Théâtre Français&mdash;a Jewish girl who had sung in the streets to the accompaniment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page243" id="page243"></a>243</span>
of her harp. Rachel appeared upon the boards, and restored its former
power of attraction to the old Classical repertoire, to the very tragedies which
the Romantic school had banished from the theatre amid mockery and derision.
<i>The Cid</i>, <i>Mérope</i>, <i>Chimène</i>, and <i>Phèdre</i> recovered their place upon
the stage.</p>

<p>Painting took the same course. In opposition to the young painters
who had burst into the arena with their gay-coloured uniforms, their gilded
helmets and waving banners, <i>Ingres</i> came forth in the great tournament of
Romanticism in the character of the Black Knight. An old gentleman, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page244" id="page244"></a>244</span>
man who in all his being belonged to the
generation that was passing away, who was
fifty years of age at the time of the Revolution
of July, stations himself suddenly as
the angel of the flaming sword, or, in the
phrase of his opponents, as the gendarme of
Classicism, at the gates of the Academy,
barring them against every suspicious-looking
person. And the young men, eccentric, eager
for action as they were, who had recently
fought with so much fury, had to retreat
before him. Golden sunshine and glow of
colour were once more tabooed, and their representative
heroes, Veronese, Rubens, and
Delacroix, regarded as flickering Will o&rsquo; the
Wisps, whom every aspiring beginner should
avoid as serpents and firebrands. One day when Ingres was taking his
pupils through the Louvre he said, on entering the Rubens gallery: &ldquo;<i>Saluez,
messieurs, mais ne regardez pas.</i>&rdquo; The acrimony of the strife was so great
that it extended even to the personal relations of the rival chiefs, and
Ingres was attacked by convulsive spasms whenever he heard the name of
the painter of the &ldquo;Massacre of Chios.&rdquo; When in 1855 he had had a
separate room prepared for his own pictures in the Universal Exhibition
of that year, and observed Delacroix in the distance, just before the opening
ceremony, he asked the attendant: &ldquo;Has not somebody been here?&mdash;there
is a smell of brimstone.&rdquo; &ldquo;Now the wolf is in the sheepfold&rdquo; was his
observation when Delacroix was elected to the Institute. He regarded him
as the &ldquo;hangman,&rdquo; as the Robespierre of painting. &ldquo;I used to love that
young man, but he has sold himself to the evil one&rdquo; (Rubens), said he, in
righteous indignation, to his pupils.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This famous thing, the Beautiful,&rdquo; Delacroix had once written, &ldquo;must
be&mdash;every one says so&mdash;the final aim of art. But if it be the only aim, what
then are we to make of men like Rubens, Rembrandt, and, in general, all the
artistic natures of the North, who preferred other qualities belonging to their
art? Is the sense of the beautiful that impression which is made upon us by a
picture by Velasquez, an etching by Rembrandt, or a scene out of Shakespeare?
Or again, is the beautiful revealed to us by the contemplation of the straight
noses and correctly disposed draperies of Girodet, Gérard, and others of David&rsquo;s
pupils? A satyr is beautiful, a faun is beautiful. The antique bust of Socrates
is full of character, notwithstanding its flattened nose, swollen lips, and small
eyes. In Paul Veronese&rsquo;s &lsquo;Marriage at Cana&rsquo; I see men of various features
and of every temperament, and I find them to be living beings, full of passion.
Are they beautiful? Perhaps. But in any case there is no recipe by means
of which one can attain to what is called the ideally beautiful. Style depends
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page245" id="page245"></a>245</span>
absolutely and solely upon the free and original expression of each master&rsquo;s
peculiar qualities. Wherever a painter sets himself to follow a conventional
mode of expression he will become affected and will lose his own peculiar
impress; but where, on the contrary, he frankly abandons himself to the
impulse of his own originality, he will ever, whether his name be Raphael,
Michael Angelo, Rubens, or Rembrandt, be sure master of his soul and of his
art.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As compared with the principles thus laid down, Ingres represents the
revulsion towards that formalism which had borne sway over the greater part
of the history of French art. &ldquo;Painting is nothing more than drawing,&rdquo; said
Poussin. &ldquo;Had God intended to place colour at the same height as form,&rdquo;
wrote Charles Blanc, &ldquo;He would not have failed to furnish His masterpiece,
Man, with all the hues of the humming-bird.&rdquo; Once more, instead of the
glowing colour of the Romantic school, absorbing the form into itself, the firm
stroke of the outline was set forth; instead of its pathos, breathing forth
passionate emotion, men returned to study the chill tranquillity of stone. Once
more dramatic composition and mastery over movement were held in abhorrence,
as incompatible with that pursuit of plastic beauty which was the highest
goal of art. The only point in question was, how to avoid the one-sidedness of
Classicism. David, as a child of the Revolution, had naturally been limited
to Ancient Rome; but now that the legitimate monarchy had been re-established
there was no reason why one should not revere, not only pagan, but
also Christian Rome, and in Raphael and Michael Angelo the maturest blossom
of the latter. Thus the Classical school was enriched by Ingres with features
of greater vivacity. He entered into a direct relationship with the great
Italian masters, while David had none save with the rigid Roman antique.
By him the Classical severity of David was relaxed, the refractory sharpness
of the outlines relieved by a treatment of
form which had the effect of making
every figure appear to be worked in
metal.</p>

<p>Ingres was born in 1781, under the
<i>Ancien Régime</i>. As a young man he
lived through the triumphs of the
Empire and the Classical school, and it
was only natural that he should become
David&rsquo;s pupil. In 1796 he entered his
studio, and studied there with such
assiduity that he never noticed what
was taking place in that of Gros. When
he went to Italy he studied there the
masters whom his own teacher had
arrogantly despised. He learned from
the Cinquecento how to draw and model
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page246" id="page246"></a>246</span>
more accurately, more firmly, and at the same time with a more intimate
grasp of the subject than was usual in the school of David. This innovation
made him a progressive Classicist, and gave him, during the early years of
the Restoration, almost the appearance of an assailant and revolutionary.
Himself the incarnation of the academic spirit, he had to resign himself to
see his first works rejected by the Salon, a fact which did not deter him from
continuing to work obstinately at his easel. &ldquo;<i>Je compte sur ma vieillesse; elle
me vengea.</i>&rdquo; And this revenge was granted him in the fullest measure.</p>

<p>When one has seen the outward appearance of a man, one knows his
character, his spirit, and his genius. Ingres&rsquo; portrait of himself contains the
analysis of his art. He was quite a small man, of a swarthy complexion, with
features sharp and as if cast in bronze. His thick black hair stood up stubbornly
on end, so that he had to grease it carefully every day. Under hair
of this kind there is almost always an obstinate brain. The jaws projected,
as is the case with men endowed with a strong will. The eyes were large and
piercing, with that bold eagle-glance which fills parents with fond hopes, but
does not touch the hearts of young women. When he appeared to be excited,
it was only the excitement of work expressing itself in him. This little man,
in his large cloak, seemed to say when he stood at his easel, pencil in hand:
&ldquo;I shall be a great painter, for I am determined to be one.&rdquo; He kept his
word. Strength of will, hard work, study, obstinacy, patience&mdash;these are the
elements of which Ingres&rsquo; talent is compounded. &ldquo;<i>Vouloir, c&rsquo;est pouvoir</i>,&rdquo;
was his motto. One would think Buffon had had him in mind in that passage
in which he defines genius as patience. The trinity-in-unity of his qualities
consisted of correctness, balance, exactness; qualities which go to make
rather a great architect or mathematician than an interesting painter.</p>

<p>Ingres&rsquo; range of subjects was unusually wide. Pictures on themes taken
from antiquity (&ldquo;&OElig;dipus and the Sphinx&rdquo; and &ldquo;Virgil reading the Æneid&rdquo;);
costume pictures (&ldquo;Henry <span class="sc">IV</span> and his Children&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Entry of Charles <span class="sc">V</span>
into Paris&rdquo;); religious paintings (Madonnas, &ldquo;Christ giving the Keys to
St. Peter,&rdquo; and &ldquo;St. Symphorian&rdquo;); nude female figures (the &ldquo;Odalisque,&rdquo;
the &ldquo;Liberation of Angelica,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Source&rdquo;); allegories (&ldquo;The Apotheosis
of Homer&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Apotheosis of Napoleon&rdquo;); pictures of public
functions (&ldquo;Bonaparte as First Consul&rdquo; and &ldquo;Napoleon on the Throne&rdquo;);
and even a painting taken from the life (&ldquo;Pius <span class="sc">VII</span> in the Sistine Chapel&rdquo;),
are included in the list. Yet, notwithstanding his astonishing diversity of
themes, there is hardly an artist more one-sided in his principles. Ingres
thought exclusively of purely plastic art: beauty of form and harmony of line
alone attracted him; he was insensible to the charm of colour. His standpoint
was the Institute of Rome; the Italian Cinquecento the exclusive object of
his worship. He carried this study as far as plagiarism, and as director of
the Roman Academy made free with the intellectual property of the Cinquecento
masters, as if they had lived only on his account.</p>

<p>When Delacroix was painting the &ldquo;Expulsion of Heliodorus&rdquo; in Saint
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page247" id="page247"></a>247</span>
Sulpice, he put forth the
whole strength of his creative
genius to avoid all reminiscence
of Raphael&rsquo;s fresco.
Ingres&rsquo; power of invention
consisted in discovering, with
a weird certainty, whether the
subject of which he wished
to treat had already been
painted by an Italian or other
Classical master. The picture
&ldquo;Jupiter and Thetis,&rdquo; of 1811,
is put together after a design
on a Greek vase, and represents
in its studied archaism
the Æginetan period of his
art. The &ldquo;Vow of Louis <span class="sc">XIII</span>,&rdquo;
of 1824, was his confession
of faith as regards the Cinquecento.
The motive was
taken from the Madonna di
Foligno, the curtains from
the Madonna di San Sisto,
the floating angels from the
Madonna del Baldacchino,
and the candlesticks as well
as the little angels with the
inscribed tablet are from the
same source. It is all beautiful, of course, for it is all Raphael; only, it
would have been more rational if Ingres had lived in the time of Raphael
instead of in the nineteenth century. One would take the picture to have
been painted under Raphael&rsquo;s eyes, and it bears to his works the same
relation as Raphael&rsquo;s earlier pictures do to Perugino&rsquo;s. The &ldquo;Christ giving
the Keys to St. Peter&rdquo; is also put together out of elements derived from
the school of Urbino. In his &ldquo;St. Symphorian,&rdquo; which was belauded as the
<i>ne plus ultra</i> of style, he turned by way of variety to the imitation of Michael
Angelo: the action is violent, the muscles swollen. The &ldquo;Apotheosis of
Homer&rdquo; is an admirable lecture in archæology, a sitting of the great academy
of genius, in which the poses are so fine and the heads so full of marble idealism
that in comparison with it Raphael&rsquo;s &ldquo;School of Athens&rdquo; has the effect of the
wildest naturalism.</p>

<p>Thus Father Ingres stands forth as a cold, stiff, academic painter, as a
doctrinaire who has not progressed much further than the much-reviled David.
He represents, as Th. Rousseau said, only to a moderate degree the good old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page248" id="page248"></a>248</span>
art which we have lost. In the words of Diaz: &ldquo;Let him be shut up with me
in a tower, without engravings, and I wager that his canvas will remain untouched,
whilst I shall succeed in producing a picture.&rdquo; He possessed an
arid ability which leaves one cold in presence of even his most important
works. How lifeless is the effect produced by his paintings of nude single
figures, his &ldquo;Odalisque&rdquo; and his &ldquo;Freeing of Andromeda,&rdquo; which brought
him especial fame! Ingres could not paint flesh, and in this respect he is
indicative of an enormous retrogression as compared with Prudhon. The
striving after sculpturesque beauty, and, in connection therewith, the repression
of all individuality, became in him almost a religion.</p>

<p>One finds it difficult to-day to account for the fame which once belonged
to his picture of &ldquo;The Source,&rdquo; the nude figure of a standing girl pouring
water out of an urn that rests on her left shoulder and is steadied by her right
arm raised over her head. The picture undoubtedly exhibits qualities of
draughtsmanship which in recent days
Ingres alone possessed in so high a
degree. But when, in pursuit of his
Classical conception, he had eliminated
every touch of nature, he proceeded to
destroy the rest of the impression by
the cold violet tones which are not
only condemned by colourists, but
which even Raphael would have considered
false and ugly. Here, as in all
his female figures, he attains to a
certain grace, but it is an animal,
expressionless grace. Skilful as he
was in delineating the muscles of the
human body, he was yet absolutely
incapable of painting heads expressive
of feeling or emotion. He depicted
the form in itself, the abstract, typical,
absolute form. He was dominated
only by a love for the <i>beauté suprême</i>,
so that when he was in presence of
nature he could not refrain from purifying
and generalising. Everywhere
we see beautiful lines, bodies modelled
with admirable skill, but we never
enter into any closer relationship with
his figures. They do not live our life
or breathe our atmosphere; they have
not our thoughts: they are foreign to
all that is human. Jean Auguste
Dominique Ingres, Member of the
Institute, Senator, etc., the stylist
held in honour as a superior being,
the high-priest of pure form and
outline, will in all times command
the esteem, and in some respects
the admiration, of the student of
the history of art; the enthusiasm,
never.</p>

<p>And yet, notwithstanding all
this, I am an enthusiastic admirer
of Ingres. Indeed, it has happened
to me, in the collection of engravings
at the Louvre, to catch myself saying:
&ldquo;Ingres! great, beloved Master!
I have much to ask your pardon; for
you were one of the greatest and
most refined spirits to whom the
century has given birth.&rdquo; For I
doubt whether any one down to the
present time has rightly understood
the mysterious figure of Ingres, the
man who in his youth was enraptured
by &ldquo;<i>l&rsquo;esprit, la grâce, l&rsquo;originalité de Vataux et la délicieuse couleur de
ses tableaux</i>,&rdquo; and who, at a later time, not because of failing powers but
deliberately and of set purpose, adopted a calmer system of colour tones;
of this Classicist <i>par excellence</i>, who is counted among the greatest artists, in
the familiar and graceful style, in the history of art.</p>

<p>Ingres is one of the rare masters whom even their opponents are forced to
admire. In the stern, sculpturesque modelling of his naked figures he displays
remarkable power. His painting, also, has a curiously intimate appeal,
due to its cool, metallic harmonies of colour&mdash;light blue, rose, and pale yellow
in particular.</p>

<p>But above all Ingres commands attention by his portraits. From his
first residence at Rome, that is, from the beginning of the century, he painted
portraits which imprint themselves on the memory like medals struck in
metallic sharpness in the style of Mantegna. Here too he is unequal, at times
cold and commonplace, but usually quite admirable. In these paintings,
cast as it were in bronze, there is something that comes from the fresh original
source of all art; they have that vein of realism by which the vigorous idealism
of Raphael is distinguished from the conventional idealism of a professor of
historical painting. Here one finds real treasures, creations of remarkable
vital power, and in admirable taste. They show that Ingres, apparently so
systematic, had a profound love for living nature, and they ensure the immortality
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page252" id="page252"></a>252</span>
of his name. His historical pictures are works which compel our
esteem, but his portraits are splendid creations which can truly stand comparison
with the great old masters.</p>

<p>So far back as 1806 there appeared in the Salon his likeness of Napoleon <span class="sc">I</span>,
with his bloodless, corpse-like face, enchased with such art that Delécluze
called it a Gothic medal. The Emperor is seated like a wax figure upon the
throne, surrounded by the attributes of majesty&mdash;stiff, motionless as a
Byzantine idol. It was followed in 1807 by the portrait of Mme. Devauçay,
which even to-day impresses the beholder most pleasingly, notwithstanding
the pedantic style in which it is painted. One feels in it fire and youthfulness,
the enthusiasm and ardour of a new convert, who has for the first time discovered
in nature beauties other than those he had learnt to see in the Academy.
Moreover, he possessed a very distinguished and personal taste in drawing.
The face is of exquisite grace, the eyes tenderly seductive and delicately
veiled. Ingres is already announced as he was afterwards to be.</p>

<p>In Holbein&rsquo;s portraits the whole German community of his time has been
handed down to us; in Van Dyck&rsquo;s, the aristocracy of England under Charles <span class="sc">I</span>.
So also Ingres has depicted for us, with all its failings and all its virtues,
the middle-class hierarchy of
Louis Philippe&rsquo;s reign, which
felt itself to be the first estate,
the summit of the nation,
felt sure of the morrow, was
proud of itself, of its intelligence
and energy, which pursued
with correctness its
moral course of life, revered
order and hated all excess&mdash;including
that of the colourist.
The same spirit animated
this splendid <i>bourgeois</i>
of art. His &ldquo;Bertin the
Elder&rdquo; is justly his most
celebrated, enduring work;
not the mere painted petrifaction
of a newspaper potentate,
but one of those portraits
which bring a whole
epoch home to the mind. It
tells of the triumph of the
<i>bourgeoisie</i> under the Monarchy
of July more fully and
clearly than does Louis
Blanc&rsquo;s <i>Histoire de Dix Ans</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page253" id="page253"></a>253</span>
In the best of humours, with the four-square solidity of a knowledge of his
own worth, which is full of character, this modern newspaper demi-god sits
on his chair as on a throne, the throne of the <i>Journal des Débats</i>, like a
<i>bourgeois</i> Jupiter Tonans, with his hands on his knees.</p>

<p>But however highly one must estimate the importance of such a work,
Ingres is nevertheless at his highest, not in his painted likenesses, but in his
portrait drawings. In the former the hard colouring is still, at times, offensive.
Almost always the flesh looks like wood, the dress like metal, blue robes like
steel. His drawings, from which this defect is absent, are to be admired
without criticism. Ingres lived in his youth, at Rome, as a drawer of portraits.
For eight <i>scudi</i> he did the bust, for twelve the whole figure, raging inwardly
the while at being kept from &ldquo;great art&rdquo; by such journey-work. There is a
story told of him, that when one day an Englishman knocked at his door and
asked, &ldquo;Does the draughtsman who makes the small portraits live here?&rdquo;
he shut the door in his face, with the words: &ldquo;No; he who lives here is a
painter.&rdquo; To-day these small masterpieces of which he was ashamed sell for
their weight in gold. In the Paris Exhibition of 1889 there was Mme.
Chauvin with her Chinese eyes; Mme. Besnard on the terrace of the Pincio
with her broad hat and her elegant sunshade; Mrs. Henting with her innocent
smile of an &ldquo;<i>honnête femme</i>&rdquo;; Mrs. Cavendish, an affected young blonde,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page254" id="page254"></a>254</span>
with her overladen travelling dress and her crazy coiffure. Strange, that a man
like Ingres should rave so about new fashions and pretty toilettes!</p>

<p>In these pieces an artistic eye which was now inexorable, now tender and
full of fancy, has looked on nature, and, in flowing pencil-strokes, has caught
with spirit and with the certain touch of direct feeling the real fulness of life
in what he saw. These drawings, especially the portrait of Paganini and
&ldquo;The Forestier Family,&rdquo; show that Father Ingres possessed not only a highly
cultivated intelligence and an iron strength of will, not only the genius of
industry, but also a heart, a genuine, warm, and fine-feeling heart; that he was
in his innermost being by no means the cold academician, the stiff doctrinaire
he appears in his large pictures, and which he became by his opposition to the
Romantic school. Here we have an enchanter such as the Primitives were
and the Impressionists are, like Massys and Manet, like Dürer and Degas, like
all who have looked Nature in the face. And while these drawings, at once
occasional and austere, place him as a draughtsman on a level with the greatest
masters in the history of art, they also show him, the reactionary, to be at the
same time a man of progress, the connecting link between the great art of the
first half and the familiar art which rules over the second half of the nineteenth
century.</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">As</span> is usually the case, the heroes were succeeded by a generation less heroic
and more practical. In this, art was in keeping with the deliberate
and tranquil course of the state itself, which had fallen back again into the old
groove, and with the homely, Philistine character assumed in the course of years
by the citizen monarchy of the tricolour. The <i>bourgeoisie</i> which had effected
the Revolution of 1830 was soon appalled at its own temerity. Even in
literature it inclined towards a temperate and lukewarm mediocrity. It was
astonished to find itself admiring Casimir Delavigne. It found in Auber and
Scribe its ideal of music and comedy, as in Guizot, Duchâtel, Thiers, and
Odilon Barrot its ideal of politics. The intellectual exaltation which had gone
before and followed after the Revolution of July had calmed down, and that
which was to rise out of the Revolution of February was as yet latent. The
same elder generation which had looked upon Napoleon Bonaparte&rsquo;s stony
Cæsarian eye, when, like a god of war, unapproachable in his power he rode
by at the head of his staff, now saw the Roi Citoyen, the long-exiled ex-school-master,
homely and fond of law and order, as every day at the same hour he
passed alone on foot and in plain clothes through the streets of Paris, the
famous umbrella in his hand, rewarding each &ldquo;Vive le Roi!&rdquo; with a friendly
smile and a grateful hand-shake. The umbrella became the symbol of this
deedless monarchy, and the word &ldquo;Juste-milieu,&rdquo; which Louis Philippe
had once employed to indicate the course to be followed, became the nickname
of all that was weak and without energy, lustreless and undignified, in
the age. The golden mean was triumphant in politics, literature, and painting.</p>

<p>The artists who gave this period its peculiar stamp constitute, as compared
with the heaven-assaulting generation of 1830, only, as it were, a collateral
female branch of that elder male line of good painting. To reconcile opposite
tendencies, to avoid harshness, in short, to bring about an artistic compromise
between Ingres and Delacroix, was the end towards which their efforts were
chiefly directed.</p>

<p><i>Jean Gigoux</i>, a remarkable artist, has the merit of having given the most
effective support which Delacroix received in his battle against the <i>beauté
suprême</i> of the Classical school. When, in the Universal Exhibition of 1889
at Paris, his picture of &ldquo;The Last Moments of Leonardo da Vinci,&rdquo; painted
in 1835, emerged from the seclusion of a provincial museum, its healthy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page256" id="page256"></a>256</span>
fidelity to nature was the cause of general astonishment. The personages
indeed wear costly costumes, and are surrounded by wealth and magnificence,
but they themselves are common, ugly human beings. Here there is no trace
of idealism, not even in the sense of Géricault, who, notwithstanding his love
of truth, remained faithful to the heroic type. The faces are, with religious
devotion, painted exactly after nature by a man who evidently loved the
youthful works of Guercino and had zealously studied Dürer. At the same
time was exhibited the portrait of the Polish &ldquo;General Dwernicki,&rdquo; painted
in 1833, whom also Gigoux depicts as a man, not as a hero. War has made
him not lean but fat, and in Gigoux&rsquo;s picture his red nose and prominent
stomach are reproduced with cruel fidelity to nature. It is a declaration of
war against every kind of idealism. Even in his religious paintings in Saint
Germain l&rsquo;Auxerrois he held fast to this principle, and this circumstance gives
him a place to himself, apart from all the productions of his contemporaries.
In a period which, with the solitary exception of Delacroix, was still absolutely
devoted to the doctrine <i>Exagérer la beauté</i>, his works are of a healthy, soul-refreshing
ugliness.</p>

<p>A portion of Delacroix&rsquo;s charm in colour descended to <i>Eugène Isabey</i>. He
is certainly not a great artist, but a delightful, sympathetic individuality, a
painter who affords one pleasure even at this day. Amid the group of Classicists
of his time he has the effect of a beautiful patch of colour, of a palette on
which shades of tender blue, mauve, lilac, brilliant green, silver-grey, red faded
by sunshine, and opalescent mother-of-pearl combine in subtle harmony.
His pretty, picturesquely costumed ladies are grouped together in luminous
gardens, sheltered by delicate half-shadows, or ascend and descend the castle
stairs, letting their long trains sweep behind them, and toying gracefully with
fan or sunshade; while gallant cavaliers do them homage, and with bent head
whisper sweet nothings in their ears. The slender greyhound plays a special
part in these aristocratic comedies; its straight lines give a counterpoise to the
soft flowing costumes of his figures. Isabey is altogether in his element when he
has to portray a ceremony requiring rich attire. Then he binds together, as it
were, a bouquet sparkling with colour, shot with the hues of ample damask
folds and heavy gold-embroidered silk. Now his colouring is <i>chic</i>, capricious,
and coquettish, now it is that of the most delicate faded Gobelin tapestry. If
he has to paint a sea-view, he rumples the waves about like a ball-dress and
pranks the ships up in bridal attire. His very storms have a festal appearance,
like the anger of a beautiful woman. One must not look for life in his pictures;
they are to the truth much what Gounod&rsquo;s <i>Faust</i> is to Goethe&rsquo;s. Watteau is
his spiritual ancestor; but he is not so full of life and wit as the painter of the
gallant world of the eighteenth century. He does not depict his contemporaries,
but the life of a vanished age; yet he has the same predilection for
scenes of high life, and a studied, mannered gracefulness which is often charming
and always pleasant to the eye. He shares with Delacroix the latter&rsquo;s
broad style, freedom from constraint, and delight in colour. But where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page257" id="page257"></a>257</span>
Delacroix is rough and violent, Isabey is
caressing and insinuating: they are not
brothers, but distant cousins. And, like
Delacroix, he had no imitators; he went on
his bright and delightful path in solitude,
and remained without companions in the
little gilded house, lit up with fantastic
lanterns, which he assigned to be the coquettish
home of charming beings of both
sexes.</p>

<p>A curious position, half-way between the
Romantic and the Classical schools, was
occupied by <i>Ary Scheffer</i>, who was, a generation
ago, the favourite of the greater part
of the aristocracy of Europe, but is now
known, to the German public at least, only
because he is said to have painted &ldquo;with
snuff and green soap&rdquo;&mdash;a phrase of Heine&rsquo;s, which, however, gives a very false
impression of him. A German-Dutchman by birth, a Classicist by training,
Scheffer in his youth came also in contact with the leading spirits of the
Romantic school; and these various influences, of race, education, and intercourse,
are clearly reflected in the faces of his figures. His forms are thoroughly
classic and generalised; only the expression of the face is ideal, while the eye
is romantic, and, Scheffer&rsquo;s German blood making itself felt&mdash;sentimental. It
was precisely this mid-way position which his contemporaries found so much
to their liking. They called his painting a great art full of style, uniting the
sentiment of ideal beauty with a captivating power of expression. But history
cares but little for these men of compromise, and regards this indecision as the
chief defect of his genius. Scheffer&rsquo;s draughtsmanship is dry and hard, his
colouring without tenderness or charm. These failings are ill-assorted with
the attitudes and physiognomy of his figures, which have always an affectation
of weakness, exhaustion, and moral suffering. He is a sentimental Classicist,
and his subjects the antithesis of the Græco-Roman ideal to which he does
homage in his technique. His &ldquo;Suliote Women&rdquo; was already, in sentiment,
form, and colour, only a subdued and weakened reminiscence of the &ldquo;Massacre
of Chios.&rdquo; At a later time he entirely forsook historical subjects (such as
&ldquo;Gaston de Foix&rdquo; and others), and attached himself with enthusiasm to the
Gospels and to the works of the poets, especially of one poet. When he had
recourse to the Bible as a source of inspiration, he selected tender episodes,
the sadness of which he transmuted into tearfulness. So also, when he represented
scenes from <i>Faust</i> or <i>Wilhelm Meister</i>, he gave to Goethe&rsquo;s animated and
impassioned characters something melancholy, suffering, and contemplative.
Heine said of his &ldquo;Gretchen&rdquo;: &ldquo;You are no doubt Wolfgang Goethe&rsquo;s Gretchen,
but you have read all Friedrich Schiller.&rdquo; Even before her fall, before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page258" id="page258"></a>258</span>
she is in love, Marguerite is pensive
and sad like a fallen angel. Mignon,
Francesca da Rimini, and St. Monica
were also favourite figures for his
delicate and contemplative spirit.
He alone in French art inclines a
little, in his tearful sentimentality, to
the Romantic school of Düsseldorf.</p>

<p><i>Hippolyte Flandrin</i> was the French
counterpart of the German Nazarenes.
He is an example of how
Ingres&rsquo; teaching resulted in stiff conventionality.
Ingres was a dangerous
master to follow. His pupils
formed round him a small, faithful,
and submissive band, swore like
those of Cornelius by the master&rsquo;s
doctrines, and for that very reason
never attained to any distinctive
character of their own. None of
them possessed Ingres&rsquo; many-sided
talent. His empire, like that of
Alexander the Great, was divided
among his successors, each of whom
governed his own little realm with
greater or less ability. Hippolyte
Flandrin devoted himself to religious painting, which in his hands for the
first time regained a greater importance in French art; but he followed
much more slavishly than Ingres in the paths of the Italian masters of the
fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. This painter, worthy of respect, full of
conviction, learned and of sterling worth, but colourless and cold, who decorated
the churches of St. Vincent de Paul and St. Germain des Prés, has enriched the
history of art by no new gift. An indefatigable worker, but endowed with
little intellectual power, he went no further than to follow out strictly the
rules which Ingres taught his pupils and had himself acquired from the old
masters. After Flandrin, as winner of the Prix de Rome in 1831, had become
intimately acquainted with the art treasures of Italy, he seldom met with any
difficulty. His cartoons are flowingly and correctly executed with a firm
hand, like the fair copy of a school essay. Of draughtsmanship he knew all
that is to be learned; he remembered much, arranged his reminiscences, and
thought little for himself. He was a miniature copy of his master, at once more
poorly endowed and more fanatical, a purely mathematical genius; his art
is a cold geometrical knowledge, the adaptation of anatomical studies to
conventional forms, an arrangement of groups and draperies in strict accordance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page259" id="page259"></a>259</span>
with celebrated exemplars. Had not the primitive Italian masters, the
painters of the ancient Christian catacombs, the saintly Fra Angelico, and the
mosaic artists of Ravenna done their work long before him, Flandrin&rsquo;s paintings
would never have seen the light, any more than those of the Nazarene school.
In both cases one can assign almost every face and figure to its original in the
pictures of the Italian masters. Only a certain blond, tender, slightly melancholy,
modern face of a Christian maiden is Flandrin&rsquo;s peculiar property. He
transferred these same ascetic and pure principles to portrait painting, and
thereby acquired for himself a large practice as the painter of the <i>femme
honnête</i>. These women conversed with him and blushed in his presence;
in his pictures we find grace and delicacy, eyes sparkling or meek, tenderness
and mocking laughter, all translated into a nun-like, unapproachable appearance,
which under the Second Empire gained the greater approbation among
ladies, since it was seldom found in real life.</p>

<p>Alongside of this Overbeck, endowed with greater artistic powers than his
German congener, there stands as the French Cornelius <i>Paul Chenavard</i>, a man
who revolved in his fertile
brain philosophical conceptions
deeper almost than
those of the German master.
He dreamed of broad, symbolical,
decorative pieces, embracing
all time and all space,
wherein all the cosmogonies
of the universe should be
united. Like Cornelius, he
wished to be a Michael Angelo,
but he succeeded no better
than the German. He spent
fifteen years in the churches
and museums of Italy, pencil
in hand, accumulating a vast
collection of studies, from
which his great painted history
of the world was to be
built up. But when he went
back to Paris his materials
from the old masters had
grown upon him to such an
extent that he never recovered
his individuality. For four
years he worked with feverish
diligence, and completed
eighteen cartoons, each six
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page260" id="page260"></a>260</span>
metres in height and four in breadth, intended for the walls of the Pantheon.
So far as colour is concerned, they have attained no greater success than the
Campo Santo frescoes of Cornelius. Chenavard could draw much better than
the German, but was not much better as a painter; the works of both have a
literary rather than an artistic value.</p>

<p>Brief and brilliant was the career of <i>Théodore Chassériau</i>, who shot across
the heavens of art like a gleaming meteor, first as a devotee of form, in Ingres&rsquo;
sense of the word, and afterwards, like Delacroix, as an enthusiastic lover of
sunshine and the clear light of Africa. Born in 1819 at St. Domingo, he
followed his teacher Ingres in 1834 to the Villa Medici; but even in his first
picture, the &ldquo;Susanna&rdquo; of 1839, now in the Louvre, he proved himself by no
means an orthodox pupil. &ldquo;He has not the least understanding for the ideas
or the changes which have entered into art in our time, and knows absolutely
nothing of the poets of recent days. He will live on as a reminiscence and a
reproduction of certain ages in the art of the past, without having created
anything to hand down to the future. My wishes and my ideas do not in the
least correspond with his.&rdquo; In these words Chassériau has himself pointed
out what it was that distinguished him from Ingres. Unfortunately he produced
but little. Personally a very elegant, <i>blasé</i> gentleman, he plunged on
his return from Italy into the whirlpool of Parisian life. He was remarkably
ugly; but his black, piercing eyes made him the idol of the ladies, and he
hurried through life with such haste that he broke down altogether at the age
of thirty-six. Beyond various decorative paintings for the church of Saint
Méry and for the Salle des Comptes in the Palais d&rsquo;Orsay, only a few Eastern
pictures, and, best and most characteristic, a couple of lithographs, remain to
represent his work. In these delicate mythological compositions a chord is
struck which found no echo until, a generation later, it was heard again in the
work of the French New Idealists and the English Pre-Raphaelites: there speaks
in them a Romantic Hellenism, a something dreamily mystic, which makes
him a remarkable link between Delacroix and the most refined spirit in the
modern school, Gustave Moreau. It was purely an act of gratitude in Moreau
when he affixed the dedication &ldquo;To Théodore Chassériau&rdquo; to his fine picture
of &ldquo;The Young Man and Death.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Léon Benouville</i> will be remembered only for his picture of the &ldquo;Death of St.
Francis,&rdquo; in the Louvre, a good piece of work in the manner of the Quattrocento.
<i>Léon Cogniet</i> deserves to be mentioned because in the fifties he brought
together in his studio so many foreign pupils, especially Germans. He enjoyed
above all others the reputation of being able to initiate beginners both quickly
and with certainty into the peculiar mysteries of craftsmanship. All that a
master can teach, and that can be learned from his example, was to be obtained
from this kind and fatherly instructor. Even after he had long given up
painting, his grateful pupils used to meet together yearly at a banquet given
in the patriarch&rsquo;s honour. As an artist he belongs to the list of the great men
who have paid for overpraise in their lifetime by oblivion after their death.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page261" id="page261"></a>261</span>
His &ldquo;Massacre of the Innocents&rdquo; of 1824&mdash;a woman who, mad with terror,
thinks to hide herself and her child from the assassins of Bethlehem under an
open stairway&mdash;could give pleasure only in a time which hailed with enthusiasm
Ary Scheffer&rsquo;s heads resembling plaster busts full of expression. Occasionally,
too, he painted landscapes&mdash;the chimerical, vague creations of a man who had
lived but little in the open air. His finest picture, &ldquo;Tintoretto Painting his
Dead Daughter by Lamplight,&rdquo; of 1843, the engravings of which once enraptured
France and Germany, has to-day a somewhat insipid effect, and
shows whither his genius was leading him&mdash;in technique a coarser Schalcken,
in sentiment a weaker Delaroche.</p>

<p>Delaroche was the Titian of Louis Philippe&rsquo;s age, the spoiled child of the
Juste-milieu, one of the most insignificant and at the same time one of the
most famous painters of the century; and in this double capacity is an interesting
proof that in art the &ldquo;Vox populi&rdquo; is seldom the &ldquo;Vox Dei.&rdquo; What a
difference between him and the great spirits of the Romantic school! They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page262" id="page262"></a>262</span>
were enthusiastic poets; their predilection for Mediævalism was concerned
only with its æsthetic charm, with the twilight shadows of its picturesque
churches, the sounding presage of its bells, the motley processions of that world
gleaming bright with uninterrupted colour. And what further allured their
imaginative powers was the unruly character of certain epochs, the destructive
war of wild factions, and the blazing, consuming power of passion. The
historical motive, as such, was with them only a pretext for launching forth
into flashing orgies of colour, according to the example, which they followed
merely in externals, of the Venetian and Flemish masters. They knew, as
genuine painters, that only in the pigment on their palette slumbers that power
of exciting emotion by means of which the art of painting touches the chords
of men&rsquo;s souls. Enthusiasts of colour and of passion, they raved about the
poets merely because the latter more readily enabled them, by means of the
fierce vehemence of the awakened powers of nature, to invest with form the
feverish, agitated, and terrible dreams of their fantasy. So it was that Delacroix
told of conflagration, of battle and warfare, of murder and pillage, of the
bitterness and pains of love. At the same time, no doubt, he studied the
vari-coloured costumes of past ages&mdash;his drawings show as much&mdash;but he made
use of them simply as a storehouse of bright hues, as a lexicon by means of
which he might embody his visions of colour. To manufacture historical
vignettes and play the part of a teacher of history would have been in his eyes
a thing to be held in contempt as the work of subservient illustrators. Yet
perhaps it was by taking this very course that far greater successes were to be
attained, so far as the verdict of the multitude is considered.</p>

<p>The decade following upon 1820 was a season of brilliant blossom for the
art of writing history in France. By his <i>History of the English Revolution</i>, in
1826, Guizot won for himself a place in the foremost rank of French authors.
He began in 1829 his famous lectures at the Sorbonne, and commenced in
1832 the publication of his <i>Sources of French History</i>. Even before him,
Augustin Thierry had written in 1825 his <i>History of the Conquest of England
by the Normans</i>, followed by <i>Stories from the Merovingian Times</i>, and was now
engaged in the preparation of his great work, the <i>History of the Origin and
Progress of the Third Estate</i>. Not unworthy to be compared with these writers,
and soon to stand beside them, were two young men working in collaboration&mdash;Mignet
and Thiers&mdash;who came to the front in 1823-24 with their <i>History of the
Revolution</i>. At the impulse thus given, historical societies and unions had arisen
in every province of France, and were developing an ever-increasing activity.</p>

<p>What learning had begun, poetry carried further. A number of writers,
young and old, began to consider what poetic use might be made of the materials
which these investigations had brought to light, and few years had passed
before the number of historical romances and dramas was hardly to be computed.
Vitet, the elder Dumas, and de Vigny put historical tragedy in the
place of classical, and the modern novel of George Sand, Balzac, and Beyle
was ousted by the historical romance. During the same years was completed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page263" id="page263"></a>263</span>
the process by which grand opera forsook
fantastic for historical subjects,
such as Auber&rsquo;s <i>Muette de Portici</i> and
Rossini&rsquo;s <i>Guillaume Tell</i>.</p>

<p>Art also sought to turn to account
the new materials furnished by historical
science, and æsthetic minds hastened
to enumerate the advantages which
were to be expected of it. On the one
hand&mdash;and this was nothing new&mdash;the
artist, whose curse it was to be born
in an inactive and colourless age, would
find here all that he sought, for history
offered him the contemplation of a
magnificent life, full of movement. On
the other hand&mdash;and this was the chief
point&mdash;painting might also fulfil an
important mission on behalf of culture,
if by virtue of its more easily understood
method it could supplement the science
of history, and by recalling the great memories of the past keep alive that
patriotism which in unfavourable conjunctures is so frequently found wanting.
Guizot recommended French history, &ldquo;the history of chivalry,&rdquo; to painters,
as the first and most important source of inspiration. &ldquo;We want historians
in the art of painting,&rdquo; wrote Vitet; and his cry was not unheard.</p>

<p>While the Romanticists had seen in the old costumes nothing more than
elements out of which a dashing colour-symphony could be obtained, troubling
themselves little about the meaning or the narrative import of their pictures,
their successors went over, bag and baggage, into the camp of the historians.
In the place of pure painting, there arose an art laden with scientific documents,
which busied itself in reconstructing former times with antiquarian
exactness. While the former had produced nought but genuinely artistic
colour-improvisations, so now a didactic aim, together with historical accuracy,
became the main consideration. The painter was commissioned as a chronicler,
an official of the state, to console citizens for the lamentable present by an
appeal to the glorious past. He became a professor of history, a theatrical
costumier who rummaged records, chose masks, cut out dresses, arranged
scenic backgrounds, for no other purpose than to depict correctly and legibly
on the canvas an historical event. And Mme. Tout le Monde found in these
pictures exactly what she required. On the one hand, the didactic aim of
historical painting, with its long explanations in the catalogues, answered
precisely to the needs of the educated middle classes. Under the picture
there was always a pretty card on which was printed this or that quotation
from some historical writer. One read the description, and then satisfied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page264" id="page264"></a>264</span>
one&rsquo;s self that the corresponding picture was really there and that it was in
keeping with the description. One recalled to mind the lessons in history
one had learned at school, and was pleased to be reminded in so pleasant a
fashion that before the nineteenth century people did not wear trousers and
frock-coats, but knitted hose and mantles. On the other hand, there still
survived enough of the Romantic unruliness to allow one to be shocked in a
decorous and moderate manner, and with the help of the catalogue a picture
might be permitted to make one&rsquo;s flesh creep in an agreeable way.</p>

<p>For the average painter of mediocre ability historical exercises of this sort
must also have been very alluring, inasmuch as they made no demand upon
specially artistic qualities&mdash;upon any peculiar aptitude of the fancy, eye, or
palette. The historian must indeed possess the power of combination, but
much more that of sober investigation; too much imagination or too great
a sense of humour would be dangerous to him. So also the historical painter
required neither fancy, sentiment, nor power of perception; a certain capacity
for compiling facts was all that was necessary. It was enough to ferret out
of some popular book on history the story of a murder, and to possess a work
upon costumes. By such means, men of a certain ability could easily manage,
with the help of the studio technique founded by the Romantic school, to put
together the most imposing show-pieces. And even the critics allowed themselves
frequently to be so far misled as to give to those models who were
decked out in the finest costumes, and labelled with the names of the most
celebrated personages, precedence over their more modest companions. Consequently
it happened that in the time of the citizen monarchy a great number
of painters entirely devoid of talent, whose only merit was that they attached
to this or that chapter of universal history
pictures showing some laboured animation,
became in the twinkling of an eye leaders of
the schools.</p>

<p><i>Eugène Devéria</i> was the first and most
important painter deliberately to enter upon
this course. When his picture of the &ldquo;Birth
of Henry <span class="sc">IV</span>&rdquo; was exhibited in the Salon of
1827 his appearance was welcomed as that
of a new Veronese, and his work joyfully
saluted as the first historical picture in which
the local colour of the epoch represented was
accurately observed. Henceforth Devéria
dressed always in the style of Rubens, and
his house became the headquarters of the
Romantic school. He was perhaps the only
member of this group in whom some breath
of Delacroix&rsquo;s spirit survived, but unfortunately
he never found again either the
Venetian tone or the male accent of his youth, and though he painted many
more pictures he never contributed a second notable work to art.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards <i>Camille Roqueplan</i> began to alter his manner. Up to
that time he had been exclusively a painter who, like Watteau and Terborg,
listened with a voluptuous shudder to the piquant rustle of silk, velvet, and
satin dresses; now he devoted himself to depicting with perspicuity various
scenes from history, renounced his airy and radiant fantasies, and became, in
his &ldquo;Scene from the Massacre of St. Bartholomew,&rdquo; nothing but a tedious
schoolmaster.</p>

<p><i>Nicolaus Robert Fleury</i>, the painter of &ldquo;Charles <span class="sc">V</span> in the Monastery of St.
Just,&rdquo; of the &ldquo;Massacre of St. Bartholomew,&rdquo; of the &ldquo;Religious Conference
at Poissy,&rdquo; and of other historical anecdotes, carefully conceived and laboriously
executed, devoted himself, like Lessing, to the propagation of noble
ideas. His pictures were manifestoes against religious fanaticism, and philanthropic
discussions concerning the trials and persecutions of the freethinkers.
In order to give them the stamp of historical verisimilitude, he buried himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page268" id="page268"></a>268</span>
with the zeal of an archivist in the study of the period to be represented;
often directly transferred into his pictures figures from Diepenbeeck or Theodor
van Thulden; and having the faculty of seizing in old paintings those tones
of colour which belong rather to the epoch than the master, he succeeded in
giving his works a certain documentary and archaic character for which, on
his first appearance, he obtained ample credit.</p>

<p><i>Louis Boulanger</i>, after his &ldquo;Mazeppa&rdquo; of 1827, was a famous painter.
But the highest success was that attained by Paul Delaroche, inasmuch as he
understood better than any other, not only how to cater for the cultured
public by the didactic nature and historical accuracy of his pictures, but also
how to touch the heart by means of a lachrymose sentimentality.</p>

<p><i>Paul Delaroche</i> belongs, by the date of his birth, to the eighteenth century.
Being one of Gros&rsquo; pupils, he had never borne the yoke of the Classical school
in its fullest weight, and therefore had never had occasion to revolt against it.
When the Romanticists came to the front, he had gone or rather been dragged
along with them, for to his circumspect nature Romanticism was an abomination,
and his cool and deliberative spirit felt itself much more at home in
the society of the Classicists. The works of the historians opened to him a
welcome outlet by which to avoid a rupture with either party, and Delaroche
found his vocation. He assumed the rôle of a peacemaker between the quarrelling
brothers, placed himself as mediator between Montagues and Capulets,
and thus became&mdash;like Casimir Delavigne in literature&mdash;the head of that
&ldquo;School of Common Sense&rdquo; on whose banner glittered in golden letters Louis
Philippe&rsquo;s motto of the Juste-milieu. Ingres was cold, reserved, and colourless;
Delaroche aspired to an agreeable, sparkling, highly seasoned, bituminous art
of painting. Delacroix was genial and sketchy; Delaroche inscribed carefulness
and exactness on his banner. The former had given offence by his boldness;
Delaroche won the conservatives over to himself by his well-bred bearing
and moderate attitude. People thought Delacroix too wild and poetical;
Delaroche took care to give them only a touch of the eagerness of Romanticism,
and set himself to reduce the passionate vehemence of Delacroix to rational,
Philistine limits, and to soften down his native unruliness into sentimental
pathos. This position which he assumed as a mediator made him the man
of his age. The life of Delacroix was a long struggle. But for the commissions
entrusted to him by the state he might have died of starvation, for his sales
to dealers and lovers of art brought him scarcely five hundred francs a year.
His studio held many pictures, leaning mournfully against each other in
corners. Delaroche, on the other hand, was overwhelmed with praise and
commissions. The representatives of eclecticism in philosophy and of the
Juste-milieu in politics found themselves compelled to praise an artist who
was neither revolutionary nor reactionist, neither Romantic nor Classical,
who had bound himself over neither to draughtsmanship nor to colouring,
but united both elements in vulgar moderation.</p>

<p>Already in his first notable works, in 1831, &ldquo;The Princes in the Tower&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Oliver Cromwell,&rdquo; he has fully assumed his lukewarm manner. He
might have represented the murder of the princes, but fearing that the public
would not stand it, he preferred merely to suggest the approaching death of
the weeping and terrified children by placing
in front of the bed a small dog, which is looking
uneasily towards the door, where the red
light of torches indicates the approach of the
assassins,&mdash;a Düsseldorf picture with improved
technique. It is just the same with his melodramatic
and lachrymose &ldquo;Cromwell.&rdquo; It
would be hardly possible to represent one of
the greatest figures in universal history in a
more paltry manner, and to this day it is not
quite certain whether the picture was intended
to be serious or humorous. The great statesman
in whom was embodied the political and
ecclesiastical revolution of England must have
been extremely busy on the day of Charles <span class="sc">I</span>&rsquo;s funeral, and have had better
things to do than stealthily to open the coffin and contemplate, with a
mixture of childish curiosity and sentimental pity, the corpse of the king
whom he had fought and conquered. Eugène Delacroix had treated this
subject in a sketch, in which Cromwell, at the funeral of Charles, gazes
in quiet contempt upon the weak monarch who had not known how to
keep either his crown or his head. As a work of art this little water-colour
is worth ten times as much as Delaroche&rsquo;s great, long-meditated, carefully
executed painting. From the very beginning he had no sense for the
passionate or dramatic. From the first day, had the tailor who prepared
costumes struck work, his artistic greatness would have fallen away to nothing;
from the commencement he produced nothing but large, clumsily conceived
illustrations for historical novels. Planché pointed out long ago that all the
costumes are glaringly new, that all the victims look as if they had got themselves
up for a masked ball, that this sort of painting is much too clean and
pretty to give the argument the appearance of probability. Théophile Gautier,
who had proclaimed the powerful originality of Delacroix, fumed with rage
against these &ldquo;saliva-polished representations, this art for the half-educated,
disguised in false, Philistine realism, this art of historical illustration for the
familiar use of the <i>bourgeois</i>.&rdquo; To rank timorous, half-hearted talent higher
than reckless and awe-inspiring genius&mdash;this was in Gautier&rsquo;s eyes the sin
against the Holy Ghost, and he sprang like a tiger upon the popularity of
talents such as these. He could, as he himself said, have swallowed Delaroche,
skin, hair, and all, without remorse; meanwhile, the public raised him
upon the shield as its declared favourite.</p>

<p>He won the intellectual middle class over to himself with a rush, as he industriously
went on rummaging in manuals of French and English history for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page272" id="page272"></a>272</span>
royal murders and battle-deaths of kings. With his &ldquo;Richelieu,&rdquo; &ldquo;Mazarin,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Strafford,&rdquo; but especially with his &ldquo;Execution of Lady Jane Grey&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Murder of the Duke of Guise in the Castle of Blois,&rdquo; he made hits such
as no other French artist of his time could put to his account. Just then, in
his youthful work, <i>The States-General at Blois</i>, Ludovic Vitet had put the
murder of the Duke of Guise upon the stage. Nothing could be better-timed
than to transform this operatic scene into colour. The historians of civilisation
admired the historical accuracy of the courtiers&rsquo; dress, all the upholstery of
the room, the lofty mantelpiece, the carved wardrobes, the praying-stool with
the altar-piece over it, the canopy-bed with its curtains of red silk embroidered
with lilies and the king&rsquo;s initials in gold. Playgoers compared the scene
with that which they had witnessed on the stage in Vitet&rsquo;s piece, and the
comparison was not unfavourable to the painter. For Delaroche, in order
to be as far as possible in keeping with the stage representation, was accustomed
to commission Jollivet, the chief mechanician of the Opera House, to prepare
for him small models of rooms, in which he then arranged his lay-figures.</p>

<p>That is the further great difference between Delaroche and Delacroix,
between the vagrant painter of history and the artist. The latter had the
gift of the inner vision, and only painted things which had intellectually laid
hold upon him and had assumed firm shape in his imagination. It was
while the organ was playing the <i>Dies iræ</i> that he saw his &ldquo;Pietà&rdquo; in a vision&mdash;that
mighty work which in power of expression almost approaches Rembrandt.
&ldquo;Is not Tasso&rsquo;s life most interesting?&rdquo; he writes. &ldquo;You weep for him,
swaying restlessly from side to side on your chair, when you read the story
of his life; your eyes assume a threatening aspect, and you grind your teeth
with rage.&rdquo; Such passionate emotion was wholly unknown to Delaroche;
he painted deeds of murder with the wildness of Mieris. Delacroix everywhere
grasps what is essential, and gives to every scene its poetical or religious
character. A couple of lines are for him sufficient means wherewith to produce
a deep impression. In presence of his pictures one does not think of costumes;
one sees everywhere passion overflowing with love and anger, and is intoxicated
with the harmony of sentiment and colour. Delaroche, like Thierry, had
merely a predilection for the historical anecdote which, dramatically pointed,
keeps the beholder in suspense, or else, simply narrated, amuses him. The
colour and spirit of events had no power over his imagination; he merely
apprehended them with a cool understanding, and put them laboriously
together in keeping with it. Delacroix sought counsel from nature; but in
the moment of creation, in front of the canvas, he could not bear direct contact
with it. &ldquo;The influence of the model,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;lowers the painter&rsquo;s tone;
a stupid fellow makes you stupid.&rdquo; Delaroche draped his models as was required,
made them posture and pull faces, and while he was painting, laboriously
screwed them up to the pathos demanded by the situation. Such a method
of procedure must necessarily become theatrical.</p>

<p>Just as in his historical pictures he endeavoured to transform Delacroix&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page273" id="page273"></a>273</span>
passion into operatic scenes, so he perfected his position as a man of compromise
by imitating the academic style in his &ldquo;Hemicycle.&rdquo; Here it was
Ingres&rsquo; laurels which robbed him of his sleep. The fame which this picture
has acquired is mainly due to Henriquel Dupont&rsquo;s fine engraving. It does
not attain to any kind of solemn or serious effect. One might imagine one&rsquo;s
self in some entirely prosaic waiting-room, where all the great men of every
age have agreed to meet together for no matter what ceremonial purpose;
one sees there a carefully chosen collection of costumes of all epochs, with
well-studied but expressionless portraits of the leaders of civilisation. Here
also Delaroche has not risen above respectable mediocrity, and his characteristics
remain, as ever, thoroughly middle-class.</p>

<p>His likeness of Napoleon is perhaps that which shows most clearly how
paltry a soul this painter possessed. It is not Devastation in human shape,
not the man in whom his officers saw the &ldquo;God of War&rdquo; and of whom Mme.
de Staël said, &ldquo;There is nothing human left in him.&rdquo; The intellect of that
Corsican, with his great thoughts striding as in seven-leagued boots, thoughts
each of which would give any single German writer material for the rest of his
life, was hidden to the inquisitive glance of a painter who had never seen in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page274" id="page274"></a>274</span>
the whole of human history anything more than a series of petty episodes.
And one who is not able to paint a good portrait is not justified in intruding
into other regions of art.</p>

<p>For similar reasons the religious paintings with which he busied himself
in his last days have likewise enriched art with no new element. They are a
Philistine remodelling of the Biblical drama, in the same style as his historical
pictures. In the end he appears himself to have become conscious how little
laborious compilations of this kind have in common with art, and since with
the best will in the world he could produce nothing better than he had painted
in the thirties, he lost all pleasure in his vocation and abandoned himself to
gloom and pessimism, from which death set him free in 1856.</p>

<p><i>Thomas Couture</i>, who after Delaroche was most in vogue as a teacher in
the fifties, was of greater importance as an artist, and in his &ldquo;Romans of the
Decadence&rdquo; produced a work which, from the point of view of the Juste-milieu,
is worthy of consideration even to-day. He was a remarkable man.
His parents, shoemakers at Senlis, seem to have regarded the thick-headed,
slowly developing boy as a kind of idiot, and are said to have treated him with
no excessive gentleness. He was sent away from school because he could
not understand the simplest things, and studied without success in the studios
of Gros and Delaroche. And yet, after he had made his début in the Salon
of 1843 with the &ldquo;Troubadour,&rdquo; a fine picture in the style of Devéria, his
&ldquo;Orgie Romaine&rdquo; of 1847 made him at one stroke the most celebrated painter
in France. Pupils thronged to him from every quarter of the globe, and he
left a deep and enduring impression upon every one of them. A very short,
corpulent, broad-shouldered, thick-set, proletarian figure, with thick disorderly
hair, a blouse, a short pipe, and a gruff manner, he used to stride
through the lines of his pupils, who regarded him with wonder on account of
his ability as a teacher and his remarkable powers.</p>

<p>Yet, when a few years had elapsed, no one heard of him again. After his
&ldquo;Love of Gold&rdquo; and a couple of portraits, he felt that he was unfruitful, and
gave up the battle. &ldquo;The Falconer,&rdquo; an excellent picture, with charming
qualities of colour, was the last work to give any proof of Couture&rsquo;s technical
mastery. He fell out with Napoleon, who wished to employ him; made many
enemies by his writings, especially among the followers of Delacroix, whom
he criticised beyond measure; and finally, embittered, and abandoning all
artistic work, he buried himself in his country place at Villers de Bel, near
Paris. Thither Americans and Englishmen used to come to order pictures
of him, and were much astonished to hear that the old gardener&rsquo;s assistant,
as they took him to be, sitting on the grass and mending shoes or old kettles,
was Couture. The news of his death in 1879 caused general astonishment;
it was as if one long buried had come to life again. It had meanwhile become
evident that even his &ldquo;Romans of the Decadence&rdquo; was only a work of
compromise, the whole novelty of which consisted in forcing the results
attained by the Romantic school in colouring into that bed of Procrustes,
the formulæ of idealism. The work is undoubtedly very noble in colouring,
but what would not Delacroix have made of such a theme! or Rubens,
indeed, whose Flemish &ldquo;Kermesse&rdquo; hangs not far from it in the Louvre.
Couture&rsquo;s figures have only &ldquo;absolute beauty,&rdquo; nothing individual; far less
do they exhibit the unnerved sensuality of Romans of the decline engaged
in their orgies. They are merely posing, and find their classical postures
wearisome. They are not revelling, they do not love; they are only busied in
filling up the space so as to produce an agreeable effect, and in disposing themselves
in picturesque groups. Even the faces have been vulgarised by idealism:
everything is as noble as it is without character. There is something of the
hermaphrodite in Couture&rsquo;s work. His art was male in its subjects, female in
its results. His &ldquo;Decadence&rdquo; was the work of a decadent, a decadent of
Classicism.</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">Four</span> years after Couture painted his &ldquo;Roman Orgy,&rdquo; Napoleon <span class="sc">III</span>
ascended the throne, and the Parisian orgy began. It was a remarkable
spectacle that the capital offered in those days&mdash;a spectacle of fairy-like,
flashing and sparkling splendour. Even to-day, when Republican Paris
endeavours as much as possible to obliterate every memory of the Empire,
Napoleon&rsquo;s spirit lives in the external appearance of the city and hovers over
every conspicuous point. Augustus might say that he had found his capital
a city of plaster and lime, and left it one of stone and bronze; Napoleon has
the right to maintain that he raised palaces where there had been barracks.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all the imprecations uttered against his rule, the most
thorough-going Republicans reluctantly concede to him the possession of one
good quality: he knew how to bring prosperity to the shop; &ldquo;<i>il faisait marcher
le commerce</i>.&rdquo; One hears it said that the beautiful city on the Seine is but
the shadow of what it then was. &ldquo;<i>Le niveau a baissé!</i>&rdquo; says the Parisian,
when he calls to mind the gorgeous days of the Empire. The extravagant
elegance, the magnificent luxury, which used to roll in superb carriages along
the Boulevards and the Champs Elysées towards the Bois de Boulogne, and
exhibited itself in the evening in the boxes of the theatres; the lustre which
emanated from the Court, and the concourse of all the nabobs of the world,&mdash;all
this must in those days have given to Parisian life a sparkling splendour,
a something stupefying and intoxicating, an alacrity of enjoyment which had
no parallel elsewhere. To the respectable, pedantic <i>bourgeoisie</i> which ruled
under Louis Philippe had succeeded a new generation of men of the world,
which drank to the lees all the refined pleasures that a modern great city
has to offer. The gentlefolk of the Empire understood the art of living better,
cultivated and exhausted it after a more inventive fashion, than any generation
that had gone before. In the Tuileries sat the man of the Second of December,
the connoisseur and promoter of all refined tastes. In his person the age was
embodied, that age depicted by Zola in <i>La Curée</i>, in the passage where he
describes the halls, illumined as if by enchantment, of the imperial palace.
There, all the splendour of over-civilisation glitters and gleams, with its bright
eyes and sparkling jewels, with its breath of intoxicating perfumes floating from
naked shoulders and arms and half-veiled voluptuous bosoms; while the green,
sphinx-like eye of Napoleon <span class="sc">III</span> rests indifferently on the alabaster sea of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page279" id="page279"></a>279</span>
white shoulders bowing before him, as he reviews all that he has possessed
and all that he can yet enjoy. Dumas&rsquo; <i>Dame aux Camélias</i>, <i>Diane de Lys</i>
and <i>Le Demi-monde</i>, Barrière&rsquo;s <i>Filles de Marbre</i>, Augier&rsquo;s <i>Mariage d&rsquo;Olympe</i>,
give the impress of the period upon literature, and the single phrase &ldquo;The
Lady of the Camelias&rdquo; conjures up a world of forms and of scenery. <i>La
Nouvelle Babylone</i> is the title of the fine book in which Joseph Pelletan depicted
the mysterious Paris of those years, the great city which cherished in its bosom
the lowest and highest extremes of a refined world of pleasure, and was at
the same time an inexhaustible fountain of arduous work.</p>

<p>One would have imagined that these new conditions of Imperial France
would have left their impress, in some way or other, upon the art of painting
also; just as in the works of Rembrandt, Frans Hals, Jan Steen, Terborg,
Ostade, Pieter de Hooch, and Van der Meer of Delft the entire seventeenth
century is reflected, clearly and with animation, treated with charming familiarity
or else with grandiose effect, in its spirit, its manner of feeling, its
habits and costumes. What a domain painting would have had; from
the official festivals and the bustle of public life down to the complete
delineation of the family home! Literature had entered into this
course a quarter of a century before, and had shown the path&mdash;a
path leading to new worlds. But in French art French society is
not reflected. Not a single painter has left us a picture of this splendid
Paris, dancing on a volcano and yet so amiably delightful. Classicism and
historical painting still held the field, as if turned to stone, and show, in
essentials, hardly any modification.</p>

<p>So far back as in 1833, Charles Lenormant wrote of the school of David:
&ldquo;Even the great painter Ingres was not able to rejuvenate a school which was
breaking up from old age, or to restore their
full resonance to the slackened and worn-out
chords; his only office was to give the old
synagogue honourable burial. Take away this
last scion of the Classical school, and the
curtain may fall&mdash;the farce is ended.&rdquo; He
might have said the same thing forty years
later, for with Cabanel and Bouguereau Classicism
has limped on, almost unchanged, to our
own days. Its art was a correct, conventional
picture-stencilling, which might just as well
have flourished a generation earlier. Classicism&mdash;which
in David was hard and Spartan,
in Ingres cold and correct&mdash;has become pretty
in Cabanel and Bouguereau, and is completely
dissolved in the scent of roses and violets.
Only a certain perfume of the <i>demi-monde</i>
brings the persons who appear as Venus, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page280" id="page280"></a>280</span>
naiads, as Aurora or Diana, into complete accord with the epoch which
produced them. For Ingres the female body itself was the exclusive canon of
beautiful form; now the swelling limbs begin to stretch themselves voluptuously
forth. Ingres still treats the human eye as it was treated in ancient
sculpture, as something animal, soulless, and dead; now it begins to twinkle
provocatively. A modern refined taste plays round the classical scheme.</p>

<p><i>Alexandre Cabanel</i>, the incarnation of the academician, was, under
Napoleon <span class="sc">III</span>, the head of the École des Beaux Arts. He was a fortunate
man. Born at Montpellier, the city of professors, nourished from his earliest
youth on academic milk, winner of the Grand Prix de Rome in 1845, awarded
the first medal at the Universal Exhibition of 1855, he went on his way,
laden with orders and offices, amid the tumultuous applause of the public.
Among the artists of the nineteenth century none attained in so high a degree
all those honours which lie open to a painter in our days. Yet, as an artist,
he remained all his life on the plane of the school of Ingres. Even his &ldquo;Death
of Moses,&rdquo; the first picture which he sent from Rome to the Salon, was entirely
pieced together out of Raphael and Michael Angelo. After that he laid
himself out to provide England
and America with those
women, more or less fully
attired, who bore sometimes
biblical, sometimes literary
names: Delilah, the Shulamite
woman, Jephthah&rsquo;s daughter,
Ruth, Tamar, Flora, Echo,
Psyche, Hero, Lucretia, Cleopatra,
Penelope, Phædra,
Desdemona, Fiammetta,
Francesca da Rimini, Pia dei
Tolomei&mdash;an endless procession.
But the only variety
in this poetical seraglio lay
in the inscriptions on the
labels; the way in which the
figures were represented was
always the same. His works
are pictures blamelessly
drawn, moderately well
painted, which leave one
cold and untouched at heart.
They possess that unusual
polish and that dexterity of
exposition which, like good
manners in society, create a
favourable impression, but are
insufficient in themselves to make
a man a pleasant companion.
Nowhere is there anything that
takes hold upon the soul, nowhere
any touch to prove that the artist
has felt anything in his painting,
or force the beholder to feel for
himself. The unvarying faces of
his figures, with their eternal
dark-rimmed eyes, resemble not
living human beings but painted
plaster casts. One would take
his &ldquo;Cleopatra,&rdquo; apathetically
observing the operation of the
poison, to be stuffed, like the
panther at her feet. One seeks
in vain for a figure that is sincere
or interesting, for a face alluring
in its truth to nature. His
&ldquo;Venus&rdquo; of 1862 made him the
favourite painter of the Tuileries,
and the insipid, rosy tints of that
picture became more and more
feeble in the course of years,
until his works resembled wearisome
cartoons, coloured by no
matter what process. He was
Picot&rsquo;s pupil, it is true, but in
reality Ingres was his grandfather,
a grandfather far, far
greater than himself, whose portraits
alone show the entire
littleness of Cabanel. All his
life long Ingres was in his portraits
a fresh, animated, and admirable
realist. Cabanel indeed
also painted in his earliest days
likenesses of ladies which were
full of serious grace, uniting a
powerful fidelity to nature with
considerable elegance. But his
success was fatal to him. Moreover,
as a portrait-painter, he became the depicter of society, and society
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page284" id="page284"></a>284</span>
ruined him. In order to please his distinguished customers, he devoted himself
far more than is good for portrait-painting to smooth rosy flesh, large
glassy eyes, and dainty fine hands, and over-idealised his sitters till they lost
every appearance of life.</p>

<p><i>William Bouguereau</i>, who industriously learnt all that can be assimilated
by a man destitute of artistic feeling but possessing a cultured taste, reveals
even more clearly, in his feeble mawkishness, the fatal decline of the old
schools of convention. He has been compared to Octave Feuillet, who also
never extricated himself from the scented atmosphere of distinguished society;
but the comparison is unjust to Feuillet. Bouguereau is in his Madonna-painting
a perfumed Ary Scheffer, in his Venus-pictures a greater Hamon;
and in his perfectly finished and faultless stencilling style of beauty he became
from year to year more and more insupportable. His art is a kind of painting
on porcelain on a large scale, and he gives to his Madonnas and his nymphs
the same smooth rosy tints, the same unreal universalised forms, until at last
they become a <i>juste-milieu</i> between Raphael&rsquo;s &ldquo;Galatea&rdquo; and the wax models
one sees in hairdressers&rsquo; shops. Only in one sense can his religious painting
be called modern; it is an elegant lie, like the whole of the Second Empire.</p>

<p>Close by Bouguereau&rsquo;s &ldquo;Venus&rdquo; in the Luxembourg hangs the well-known
colossal figure of a beautiful nude woman with unnaturally over-developed
thighs, which by the shining mirror in its uplifted right hand proclaims itself
to be &ldquo;Truth.&rdquo; <i>Jules Lefébure</i>, the painter of this picture, is also completely
a slave to tradition; he came from
Cogniet&rsquo;s studio, and won the Prix de
Rome in 1861. But he at least possesses
more taste, elegance, and character;
his painting of the nude is more
distinguished, truer, and more powerful.
He is in the broader sense of the word
a worshipper of nature, and was so in
his youth especially. His &ldquo;Sleeping
Girl&rdquo; of 1865 and his &ldquo;Femme couchée&rdquo;
of 1868 are smooth and honest studies
from the nude, of delicate, sure
draughtsmanship, and have therefore
not become antiquated even to-day.
Unfortunately he did not find this
masculine accent again, when at a
later time he grouped ideal figures together
to make pictures of them. His
&ldquo;Diana surprised&rdquo; of 1879 was a very
clever composition of well-ordered lines,
possessing even fine details, especially
one or two charming heads, but as a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page285" id="page285"></a>285</span>
whole it is lifeless and uninteresting. Like Bouguereau, he lacks power, and,
notwithstanding his distinction and his capacity for arrangement, he is not
painter enough to be truthfully entitled a &ldquo;painter of the nude.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In general, French art, however willingly it took to this sphere during
the period we are considering, is rich indeed in well-drawn documents, but
poor in works which, considered as painting, can bear the most distant comparison
with Fragonard and Boucher. The Revolution had put an end to
the joyous flesh-painting of French art. At the close of the eighteenth and the
beginning of the nineteenth century the painter of tender and life-like flesh-colour
was not the reformer David, but the despised Prudhon. The former
found his ideal in statues, and turned flesh to stone. The latter, a direct
descendant of Correggio, gave expression to life with a tender mellowness.
Ingres was again, like David, a very mediocre flesh-painter, and the Romanticists
entered this sphere but seldom. Delacroix indeed has in his &ldquo;Massacre&rdquo;
a couple of excellent touches, but they are isolated phenomena in his work.
After 1850 the approved system was to give nude female figures the appearance
of being made of terra-cotta, biscuit, or ivory. The forgotten art of painting
velvety, soft flesh, and of making it vibrate in light, had to be learned over again,
and to this meritorious task <i>Henner</i> devoted himself&mdash;the modern Correggio
from Alsace, who stands to Cabanel in the same relation as Prudhon to David.
Even Henner in his later days has become very much a mannerist, and has
done some very bad work. To-day he prefers a heavy, pasty, buttery style
of painting, with faces which look as if they had been pickled in oil, and have
an unreal expression; his contrasts of light and shade, once so delicate, have
become raw and forced. Yet beside Cabanel he still appears the true poet of
female flesh-painting, the dreamy graceful depicter of refined sensuality.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page286" id="page286"></a>286</span>
Prudhon&rsquo;s delicate ideal and his
language of vibrating tenderness are
revived in Henner. His &ldquo;Nymph
resting&rdquo; in the Luxembourg has
the same soft <i>morbidezza</i>, the same
delightful mystery, in which Prudhon
before him had enveloped the
sweetness of smiling faces and the
beauty of female forms. He too
chose the Lombards as his guides.
After winning the Prix de Rome in
1858, he sent to the Salon of 1865
a &ldquo;Susanna,&rdquo; which already shows
his ability as a flesh-painter and his
relationship to Correggio. And a
Lombard he has remained all his
life. One could with difficulty find
a more delicate and smooth study
of the nude than his &ldquo;Biblis&rdquo; of
1867.</p>

<p>Since that time another tendency highly characteristic of Henner has
shown itself in his work. In his endeavour to render the tint and tender
softness of flesh as delicately as possible, he sought at the same time for light
which should intensify the clear tone of the nude body. These he found
in that time of evening, which one might call Henner&rsquo;s hour, when the landscape,
overshadowed by the twilight, gradually loses colour, and only a small
blue space in the sky or a silent forest-lake still for a moment preserves the
reflection of vanishing daylight. In this tranquil harmony of nature after
sunset, the white pallor of the human body seems to have absorbed all the daylight
and to be giving it forth again, while the surrounding landscape is already
merging into colourless shadow. This is Henner&rsquo;s &ldquo;second manner,&rdquo; and he
raised it into a system. Every year since then there has appeared in the Salon
one of those pale nymphs, standing out so mistily against the dark green of
an evening landscape, or one of those Virgilian eclogues, in which the gloaming
rests caressingly upon nude white bodies. And by this method of painting
flesh and of throwing light upon it, Henner has won for himself an important
place in modern art.</p>

<p><i>Paul Baudry</i>, the powerful decorator of the Grand Opera House at Paris,
marks the close of this tendency. In his work the endeavours of all those
talented artists who sought to found a new school of &ldquo;ideal painting&rdquo; upon
the basis of the study of the Italian Classicists came to a crowning height;
and at the same time Baudry took a further step onward, in that he vivified
the classical scheme with a yet more marked cast of &ldquo;modernity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His first picture, on the murder of Marat, was feeble. What David had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page287" id="page287"></a>287</span>
executed smoothly and forcibly in his dead &ldquo;Marat,&rdquo; Baudry spoiled in his
&ldquo;Charlotte Corday.&rdquo; The bath, the night-table with the inkstand on it, the
map on the wall, and all the fittings of the room, are painted with the greatest
finish, but the young heroine in her petrified idealism has no more life in her
than there is in the furniture.</p>

<p>His &ldquo;Pearl and Wave,&rdquo; which is hung in the Luxembourg close to Cabanel&rsquo;s
and Bouguereau&rsquo;s &ldquo;Birth of Venus,&rdquo; gave proof of progress. A deep-blue
wave, towering on high and crowned with foam, has washed a charming woman
ashore like a costly pearl. She seems to have just awakened out of slumber,
and her roguish, moistly gleaming eyes are smiling. Saucily she leans forward
her fair-haired head under her bended arms, and stretches out in easy motion
her youthfully slender yet fully proportioned body. Bouguereau&rsquo;s and even
Cabanel&rsquo;s female beauties are waxen and spoiled by retouching, but Baudry&rsquo;s
Cypris is a living being, and preserves some of the individual charm of the
model.</p>

<p>It is this breath of realism which gives their attractiveness to Baudry&rsquo;s
pictures in the Paris Opera House. He cannot indeed be ranked as a truly
great master of decorative
painting, as the Fragonard of
the nineteenth century; he
was too eclectic. The five
years, from 1851 to 1856,
which as winner of the Prix
de Rome he spent in the
Villa Medici, were the happiest
of his life. He saw in
the Italian galleries neither
Holbein nor Velasquez, neither
Rembrandt nor Botticelli nor
Caravaggio. He saw nothing
and revered nothing save the
pure tradition of the Cinquecento,
which was to him the
Alpha and Omega of art. He
dreamed of great decorative
works which should place him
on an equality with those old
masters. It was therefore
joyful news to him when, at
the suggestion of his old
comrade Charles Garnier, he
was commissioned to adorn
the Opera House. Baudry was
then thirty-five years old,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page288" id="page288"></a>288</span>
in possession of his full powers, and yet he thought it necessary to go back
to Italy to interrogate the masters of the Renaissance anew. For a full year
he worked ten hours daily in the Sistine Chapel. As soon as he knew Michael
Angelo by heart, he betook himself to England to copy Raphael&rsquo;s cartoons,
and then in 1870 for the third time to Italy, before he felt himself capable
of covering the five hundred square metres of canvas. The task took him four
years, and when it was exhibited at the Palais des Beaux-Arts in 1874, prior
to being placed in its final resting-place, there was general astonishment at a
single man&rsquo;s power to produce so much and such great work.</p>

<p>To-day his praise cannot be sounded so high. The place to which he
aspired, by the side of the great masters of the Renaissance, will not fall to
Baudry&rsquo;s lot; he is hardly to be reckoned even among the great French masters
of the nineteenth century. To rise even so far he lacked the first and most
essential gift&mdash;originality. He was a model pupil in his youth, and a pupil
he remained all his life. He always saw nature through the medium of art,
and never had the courage to take a fresh breath and plunge into its fountain
of youth. Between him and reality there was ever the prism of the old
pictures that he loved; brush in
hand, he devoted himself, turn
by turn, and with equal enthusiasm,
to Michael Angelo, Titian,
Correggio, Bronzino, and even
Ingres. As soon as he returned
from Italy for the first time, as
holder of the Prix de Rome, he
exhibited several pictures which
were altogether Titian in colouring,
altogether Raphael in style.
Each of them, even the most
important, calls some other painting
to one&rsquo;s mind. His &ldquo;Fortune
and the Child&rdquo; is a variation
upon Titian&rsquo;s &ldquo;Divine and
Earthly Love&rdquo;; his &ldquo;Death of a
Vestal Virgin&rdquo; a reminiscence of
the &ldquo;Death of Peter Martyr&rdquo;;
his &ldquo;Warrior&rdquo; in the Opera
House is the painted double of
Rude&rsquo;s &ldquo;Marseillaise.&rdquo; How
many gestures, attitudes, and
figures could, by a close analysis,
be shown to be borrowed in turn
from Veronese, Andrea del Sarto,
Correggio, or Raphael! His
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page289" id="page289"></a>289</span>
works are a synthesis of the favourite forms of the Cinquecento; they are
the testament of the Cinquecento masters. He was a Parisian Primaticcio,
a posthumous member of the old school of Fontainebleau. In him was
embodied the last smile of the Renaissance, the results of which he assimilated
and reduced to formulæ. He lacked creative imagination, and
his pictures are wanting in individual character. The nervous movement
and sinewy stretchings of his young men&rsquo;s bodies would never have been
painted but for Donatello&rsquo;s &ldquo;David.&rdquo; Of his women, the powerful and
muscular are descended from Michael Angelo&rsquo;s &ldquo;Eve,&rdquo; the more slender and
elegant come down from Rosso. His palette, with its blue and white tints,
is bright and flowery, but it is no less artificial than his composition.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it would be unjust to speak of Baudry&rsquo;s work as merely
faded Classicism, or as Michael Angelo and water. He was not merely a
pupil of the Italians; he contributed something Parisian of his own, something
pretty, mannered, refined, graceful, seductive, and smiling, and felt himself
independent enough to give to his conventional figures this sprightly addition
of genuinely modern nervosity. The birth-certificates of his young men
were drawn up in Florence, those of his young women in Rome, three hundred
and fifty years ago; yet there is in the latter something of the <i>Parisienne</i>, in
the former something of the modern dandies who know the fevered life of the
Boulevards. In his delightful art there is French wit, there is a touch of
the piquant, of the feminine, of the ambiguous, which almost amounts to
indecency. One can still recognise the charming model in the figures of his
dancers and Muses; you can see that Music&rsquo;s or Poetry&rsquo;s waist was laced up in
a close-fitting corset before she sat for the picture. One may meet these
women at any moment, trailing their dresses along the sidewalks of the
Boulevards, or riding negligently in their carriages back from the Bois de
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page290" id="page290"></a>290</span>
Boulogne. And still more modern than the wasp-like form of the body is
the character of the face and the smile on the lips. Thus Baudry has given
a new shade to the manner in which one can obtain inspiration from the old
masters. To all that he borrowed he added a personal and charming note.
He possesses an elegance and grace which are neither Correggio&rsquo;s, nor Raphael&rsquo;s,
nor Veronese&rsquo;s, but French and Parisian. His Muses and Cupids, his &ldquo;Comedy&rdquo;
and his &ldquo;Judgment of Paris,&rdquo; are documents of the French spirit in the
nineteenth century, and&mdash;together with a few small and fine portraits on a
green or blue background <i>à la</i> Clouet, among which that of his friend About
takes the first rank&mdash;they will always assure him an important place in the
history of French art.</p>

<p>Another artist who worked with Baudry at the decoration of the Grand
Opera House was <i>Élie Delaunay</i>, who painted in a hall leading out of the foyer
three large pictures on the myths of Apollo, Orpheus, and Amphion, and was
at that time less appreciated than he deserved. Delaunay was born in the same
year as Baudry, and, like him, was a Breton. In their genius also they are
very similar. He shared in Baudry&rsquo;s admiration of the masters of the
Renaissance, but his worship was less for the Cinquecento than the fourteenth
century. It was in Flandrin&rsquo;s studio that he prepared himself for his entry
into the École des Beaux Arts. His first picture, in 1849, &ldquo;Christ healing
a Leper,&rdquo; was, with respect to its Roman manner of conceiving form and its
bronze-like firm draughtsmanship, still entirely in the style of Ingres. It was
not till he went to Italy in 1856, as winner of the Prix de Rome, that he turned
from the works of the Roman school to those of the early Renaissance masters,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page291" id="page291"></a>291</span>
to whom he was attracted by their rigorous study of form and their manly
severity. His sketch books were filled with drawings after Paolo Uccello,
Filippo Lippi, Pollajualo, Ghirlandajo, Botticelli, Gozzoli, and Signorelli.
It was just at this time that French sculpture was making its significant revolt
against the antique and in favour of Donatello, Verrocchio, and Della Robbia;
that the Prix de Florence was founded, and that Paul Dubois&rsquo; &ldquo;Florentine
Singer&rdquo; appeared. Delaunay became as a pupil of the Quattrocento masters
one of the greatest draughtsmen of the century, a healthy Naturalist in the
sense in which the Primitives were so, with a concise and firm power of design
which only Ingres amongst modern French painters shares with him. The
bodies of his nude male figures are strained in nerve and muscle like those
of Donatello; they have the essential elegance and powerful rhythm of Dubois&rsquo;
statues. Even the two pictures which he sent from Italy to the Salon, &ldquo;The
Nymph Hesperia fleeing from the Pursuit of Æsacus,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Lesson on
the Flute&rdquo; in the Museum at Nantes, were works of great taste and sincerity,
studied with respectful and patient devotion to nature, without striving
after sentimental effect and without conventional reminiscences. When in
1861 he returned from Rome, he completed the frescoes in the church of
St. Nicholas in Nantes, which, in
their strict severity, remind one of
Signorelli&rsquo;s Cycle at Orvieto. In
1865 appeared in the Salon his
&ldquo;Plague at Rome,&rdquo; which afterwards
passed into the Luxembourg, and
which is not devoid of tragic accent.
In that collection hangs also his
&ldquo;Diana&rdquo; of 1872, a proud nude
figure drawn with firm and manly
lines, and full of grave dignity, after
the manner of Feuerbach. At the
same time as his &ldquo;Diana&rdquo; he exhibited
his portrait of a Mlle. Lechat,
seated like one of Botticelli&rsquo;s Madonnas
in front of a trellis of roses&mdash;in
the style of the old masters, and yet
modern, naturalistic, and in excellent
taste. Thenceforth he took his place
among the first portrait painters of
his time. There is an inexorable love
of truth, a something bronze-like and
stony in his pictures, finished as
they are with the firm impress of
medals. Instances of this may be
found in his fine portrait of Mme.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page292" id="page292"></a>292</span>
Toulmouche, whom he has represented
in a white summer
costume, with black gloves,
seated in the midst of cheerful
landscape; and also in several
male heads drawn with that
firmness of modelling which
Bronzino in his best days alone
possessed. After the completion
of the Opera paintings he
finished, in 1876, twelve decorative
pictures for the great hall
of the Council of State in the
Palais Royal. His last works,
which remained unfinished,
were designs for the Pantheon&mdash;scenes
from the life of St.
Geneviève&mdash;in which he followed
in the footsteps of the
great fresco colourists of Upper
Italy, Gaudenzio Ferrari and
Pordenone. Élie Delaunay
was no original genius, and as
a pupil of the painters of the
Quattrocento has not enriched the history of art in any way, but he stands
forth, in a time which cared for nothing but external effect, as a very loyal,
serious, and honest artist, whose works all bear the stamp of a healthy, manly
spirit.</p>

<p>Though in the works of these masters the Classicism of Ingres passes away,
in part enfeebled and in part imbued with modern elements and vivified by
a more direct study of nature, yet on the whole Paul Delaroche dominates
this period also. Historical painting takes the highest places in the Salon,
and shows itself altered only in this respect, that, instead of Delaroche&rsquo;s tameness
of style, we have sensational subjects, arguments which revel in scenes of
horror and display of corpses. Literature had already entered upon this path.
Even Mérimée in his last novel, <i>Lokis</i>, was clearly the forerunner of that
tendency in taste which Taine characterised by the words, &ldquo;<i>Depuis dix ans
une nuance de brutalité complète l&rsquo;élégance</i>.&rdquo; Flaubert himself, in his <i>Salambo</i>,
was to some extent carried away by the stream. Consider, for instance, the
descriptions of Gisko crawling, a maimed, shapeless stump, out of the ditch
into Matho&rsquo;s tent, and of how his head is sawn off; of the tortures inflicted by
the Carthaginian people upon the captured Matho; or of how the mercenaries
are starved to death in the rocky valley where they were imprisoned. Vying
with this tendency of literature, painting attained in its chosen themes an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page293" id="page293"></a>293</span>
over-excitation which reached the limits of the possible. While Delaroche
had only in a very timid manner led the way to the tragedies of history, the
younger artists hunted up all the most horrible deeds of blood to be found in
the great Book of Martyrs of the story of man, and elaborated them on gigantic
canvases. It would be quite impossible to draw up a catalogue of all the
murders at that time perpetrated by French art. They might be arranged
under various headings, as biblical, historical, political murders; murders
in connection with robbery, and murders arising out of revenge; with subdivisions
corresponding to the means employed, as poison, the dagger, the
halter, broadsword and rapier, the bowstring, strangling, burning, etc. This
was the time when, on account of this dominance of the &ldquo;<i>Genre féroce</i>,&rdquo; the
public used to call the Salon the Morgue.</p>

<p><i>Toudouze</i> painted the &ldquo;Fall of Sodom&rdquo; with a dozen copper-coloured
Abyssinians, larger than life, rolling on the ground in convulsions, while Lot&rsquo;s
wife, dying and half-consumed by fire, gnashes her teeth as she raises the
corpse of her child over her head. In a picture of <i>George Becker&rsquo;s</i> were represented
the corpses of King Saul&rsquo;s sons, delivered over by David to the Gibeonites,
hanging alongside of each other
in a dark forest scene on a cross-shaped
framework, like butcher&rsquo;s
meat from the shambles. Their
mother stands beneath the scaffold,
swinging a knotted club to
protect the corpses from an antediluvian
vulture. In a painting
by <i>Bréhan</i>, Cyaxares, King of
the Medes, gives a banquet, and
by way of dessert has his guests
the Scythian leaders massacred
by his mercenaries. In one by
<i>Matthieu</i>, Heliogabalus has hit
upon a yet happier idea, for at
the conclusion of the meal he
sets half-starved lions and tigers
upon his guests. <i>Aimé Morot</i>
depicted in a large picture &ldquo;The
Wives of the Ambrones&rdquo; in the
battle of Aquæ Sextiæ. They
are hurling themselves like a
horde of furies upon the Roman
horsemen who are attacking the
camp. Half-naked, or entirely
so, with their hair flowing behind
them, they throw themselves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page294" id="page294"></a>294</span>
upon the Romans, catch hold of the swords by the blade, tear their eyes
out, and are trampled beneath the horses&rsquo; hoofs. Especially popular were
the voluptuous and cruel wild beasts from the menagerie of the Cæsars.
Nero in particular suited the atmosphere of the period; his ghost haunted
the novel, the stage, sculpture, and painting, and there seemed to be a general
agreement to immortalise him and the morally monstrous personality of
Locusta. In a picture by <i>Sylvestre</i> he is represented with florid cheeks, glowing
with fat, and gloating over the mortal agony of a slave lying on the ground,
upon whom Locusta has tested the poison intended for Britannicus. <i>Aublet</i>
varied the same theme by making a negro lad the victim, while several corpses
of negroes lying in the background suggest that the Emperor was not quite
satisfied with Locusta&rsquo;s first experiments. Round Nero, the more entirely
to fill his magnificent Golden House, the charming shades of his congenial
comrades in crime weave their flitting dances. <i>Pelez</i> depicted the strangling
of the Emperor Commodus by the gladiator to whom the Empress had entrusted
the task, and painted with tender interest the marks caused by suffusion of
blood which the athlete&rsquo;s hand had left upon the unhappy prince&rsquo;s neck. A
very familiar figure is that of Seneca, with distorted features, uttering his last
words of wisdom while the blood
pours from his opened veins. After
the madness of the Cæsars comes the
atrocious history of the Merovingian
kings. <i>Luminais</i>, the painter of
Gauls and barbarians, represented in
his large picture &ldquo;Les Énervés de
Jumièges&rdquo; the sons of King Clovis II,
who, after the muscles of their knees
have been destroyed by fire, are set
helplessly adrift in a boat on the
Seine. Then followed torture scenes
from the time of the Inquisition, and
saints burning at the stake. The
conception which this post-Romantic
generation had of the East was of
cruelty and voluptuousness mixed, a
thing pieced together out of white
bodies, purple streams of blood, and
brown backgrounds. Here, the favourite
Sultana contemplates the
severed head of her rival, which
stares at her out of its glassy eyes;
there, eunuchs are making ready to
strangle a woman condemned to
death. In works such as these the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page295" id="page295"></a>295</span>
genius, powerful in composition,
of Benjamin Constant, celebrates
its triumphs.</p>

<p>Yet, notwithstanding all the
means of allurement furnished
by such themes, these paintings
almost invariably fail to produce
the anticipated effect. Not that
it is the brutality of the subjects
that makes them unpleasant.
Art in all times has busied itself
with the horrible. How voluptuously
does Dante depict the
horrors of Hell! What imagination
was ever peopled with
figures more dreadful than
those conceived by Shakespeare?
Cruelty and death have a poetry
of their own: why should Art
prudishly abstain from depicting
them? Only, if the result is to
be a good picture, the subject
must be in strict congruity with
the talent employed upon it, and
in the majority of these works this conformity is lacking. The subjects
alone had become more savage and brutal. In the manner of treatment
there is none of the wild effect which the Neapolitans of the seventeenth
century gave to their scenes of martyrdom. Spirits truly wild, like
Delacroix and Caravaggio, are not to be met with every day. The painters
who launched out upon these bloodthirsty themes took absolutely no
inward &ldquo;enjoyment in tragical subjects,&rdquo; but simply painted them as if
after precepts learned at school. And as they were also deficient in that
knowledge of nature which is acquired only by direct study of life, not
one of them was in a position to give to his historical scenes that naturalistic
weight which alone gives to such themes a character of convincing probability.
True, these pictures compel respect on account of their unusual ability. These
naked bodies, twisting themselves in the most varying postures of pain, give
proof by their correct draughtsmanship of the most painstaking anatomical
studies, yet after all they are nothing more than inverted Laocoöns. The
Classical spirit haunts them still, and a discordant effect is produced when
subjects so full of wild passion are tranquilly depicted according to cold conventional
rules. Over all these figures and scenes, even the most horrible,
lies the veil of a Classical embellishment, which deprives them altogether of
that directness which lays hold on the imagination. The pictures are good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page296" id="page296"></a>296</span>
studies of costume, and make an admirable impression by their resplendent
glow of colour; they are show-pieces, brilliant stage effects, as happily conceived
as any of Sardou&rsquo;s. But the recipe for their production is still that of
the school of Delaroche: avoidance of all extremes, generalised forms, careful
composition, crude lukewarmness, or the affectation of daring. Scarce one
of these painters has given to his wild subject an equal wildness of treatment;
not one has raised himself from the paltry level of Delaroche to the artistic
height of Delacroix.</p>

<p><i>Laurens</i> alone, surnamed by his comrades &ldquo;the Benedictine,&rdquo; because his
predilection was for forgotten themes from ecclesiastical history, constitutes
in a certain sense an exception to the rule. He too belongs to the group of
historical painters whose theory is that a picture should represent an historical
fact with absolute accuracy. But he is more masculine than Delaroche. His
personages are truer to nature, or, if one will, less banal; the general effect
is warmer and fuller of life; he has a greater power of attracting attention.
There is nothing great in his work, but there is no cold pedantry: the art of
combination is more adroit, so that one is less aware of calculation, and may
sometimes observe a grim earnestness. He really loves the terrible, while
the others merely made use of it for the manufacture of what are nothing
more than tableaux. To the Inquisition especially he was indebted for
notable successes, and at times he was able to depict its dark scenes of horror
in a very subtle manner. When he heaps up, in front of a church, corpses to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page297" id="page297"></a>297</span>
which the priests have refused burial; when he disinters popes in order to
place them in the dock before their accusers; when he opens coffins to reveal
the decomposed features of some erstwhile beauty, he sets even blunted
nerves on the stretch; and as he has therein attained the goal he had proposed
to himself, his art is not without its justification.</p>

<p>Among the younger generation, <i>Rochegrosse</i>, an artist of daring genius,
appeared for a while to have taken to such themes by free choice, and not solely
through the traditions of the studio. One seemed to observe in his works a
truly emotional temperament flaming behind the trammels of conventionality,
and was almost inclined to rank him among the spirits of storm and stress who
trace their descent from Delacroix. After his first picture, in which &ldquo;Vitellius&rdquo;
is represented dragged through the streets of Rome and ill treated by the
populace, he achieved success with a scene taken from the destruction of Troy.
Here &ldquo;Andromache,&rdquo; raging with impotent anguish, is struggling against a
number of Greeks who have snatched her child from her arms to throw it down
from the ramparts. This brutal strife is depicted with the highest naturalistic
power. Neither the heroine nor the warriors belong to the ideal figures of the
style of compromise. Andromache is of a fulness of form almost approaching
corpulence, and the Greeks remind one of Indians on the warpath. Mangled
corpses complete the picture, and on the bare wall to the left, over the stairs,
hang dead bodies abandoned to corruption and the birds of prey. In his
third picture he took for his theme the horrors of the barbarous and ferocious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page298" id="page298"></a>298</span>
Peasants&rsquo; War in the fourteenth century, as Mérimée had described them in his
book entitled <i>La Jacquerie</i>; and his work is all the more effective as there lurks
in the subject a certain grim modern touch which reminds one of the Social
Democracy, of the insurrection of the Commune, of something which might
happen even to-day. The insurgents break into the hall, where the ladies
of the castle have taken refuge with their children. One alone stands erect,
the grandmother in her nun-like widow&rsquo;s dress, and stretches her arms behind
her with a gesture of energy, as if to shield the younger ones at her back. The
foremost intruder ironically takes off his cap. Another lifts up on his pike the
fair-haired, bleeding head of the lord of the castle; a third has similarly transfixed
his reeking heart. Others are pressing in from without, breaking the
window panes with their weapons, which are yet dripping with blood. Beneath
frightful figures are seen, the most horrible that of a woman standing on the
window-sill, her hands propped upon her knees, gazing with insane laughter
upon the mortal terror of the aristocratic ladies.</p>

<p>In his subsequent pictures Rochegrosse did not go so far afield. His
&ldquo;Murder of Julius Cæsar&rdquo; was a work of art in white upon white, full of crude
imagination, with white walls, white reflections of light, white togas, and dark
red blotches of blood. His grass-eating &ldquo;Nebuchadnezzar&rdquo; proved that from
the sublime to the ridiculous there is often only a step. Between times he
painted archæological trifles for ladies of literary culture, such as the &ldquo;Battle of
the Sparrows&rdquo; of 1890; but in his great &ldquo;Fall of Babylon&rdquo; he has proved once
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page299" id="page299"></a>299</span>
more what he can do. No doubt it is not a fine work: it is a mere decorative
piece, but an astonishingly spirited performance. The scene is the palace of
the Babylonian kings, the decorative construction of which the recovered
monuments and the recent scientific investigations had rendered it possible to
reproduce. Rochegrosse consulted with the zeal of an archæologist all the
treasures of the Louvre and the British Museum,&mdash;Assyrian friezes, ornaments,
and costumes,&mdash;and then set forth in these surroundings the famous banquet
at which the Prophet Daniel explained the words &ldquo;Mene, Tekel, Peres.&rdquo; The
day begins to break; in the distance the army of the Medes advancing to attack
the palace has burst open the gate; Belshazzar leaves the table in terror,
and takes to his weapons; the naked women, still intoxicated, stretch their
limbs, or remain lazily indifferent lying on the ground; around is a dazzling
confusion of mosaics, of polychrome architecture, of fantastic images of
animals, of glittering tapestries shot with many hues and pleasing to the
eye; of flowers, vases, fruits, pastry, and nude bodies of women. The grey
light of morning strives to overcome that of the half-extinguished lamps, and
rests with leaden weight upon the gigantic still-life below.</p>

<p>If some portion of Delacroix&rsquo;s
wild genius appears to have descended
upon Rochegrosse, yet was
<i>Henri Regnault</i>, as a colourist, the
greatest of Delacroix&rsquo;s heirs&mdash;even
allowing for the exaggerated renown
which came to him in France, from
the fact that he was the last to fall
in the war of 1870. His portrait
of &ldquo;General Prim&rdquo; of 1869, which,
rejected by the sitter, came eventually
to the Louvre, is somewhat
reminiscent of Velasquez and Delacroix,
but is nevertheless, with
those of Géricault, amongst the
finest equestrian portraits of the
century. In his &ldquo;Salome&rdquo; he has
depicted a black-haired girl with
twitching feet, resting upon a stool
after her dance, and contemplating
with the cruelty of a tigress the
platter which she holds ready for the
head of John the Baptist, while her
glowing red mouth with its dazzling
teeth smiles like that of an innocent
child. In her he has embodied
with infernal subtlety the demon of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page300" id="page300"></a>300</span>
voluptuous wantonness, and has composed
a symphony in yellow of seductive
and dazzling charm. She is attired in
transparent gold-inwoven robes, which
have a caressing congruity with the
resplendent texture of the background.</p>

<p>His &ldquo;Moorish Headsman&rdquo; is a
symphony in red. In his pale rose-red
garb the tall Moor stands in majestic
dignity, wipes a few drops of
blood from the blade of his sword, and
glances with careless indifference&mdash;a
type of the dreamy cruelty of Oriental
fatalism&mdash;without anger and without
pity, without hatred and without satisfaction,
upon the severed head with its
distorted eyes, which, rolling down a
couple of steps, has stained the white
marble with purple patches of blood.
&ldquo;I will cause the genuine Moors to rise
again, at once rich and great, terrible
and voluptuous,&rdquo;&mdash;so the voice of
Delacroix speaks out of this picture by
Regnault. His paintings, like those of
his master, have the effect of splendid
Oriental costumes; they are shot with
every hue, they lighten and glisten, they
are inwoven with magnificent arabesques
of gold and silver, with sparkling embroideries
and precious stones. The
&ldquo;Orlando Furioso&rdquo; of art lives once
more in these fascinating harmonies, in
the power, splendour, and lustre of the colouring. Just as Baudry at the close
of the Classical period produced in his paintings for the Opera House the noblest
work after the idealist formulæ, so Regnault in his &ldquo;Salome&rdquo; and his &ldquo;Prim&rdquo;
has completed the last defiant works of the formulæ of Romanticism.</p>

<p>We have thought it advisable to follow this development of the art of
painting down to its close, just as in treating of the older periods we have
proceeded, not upon chronological principles, but upon those of historical
style. Now that the old art has been followed to the grave, it will be all the
easier, later on, to perceive clearly how the new arose slowly out of its invisible
depths. And as France since 1830 has become the high school of art for other
nations, those paths have at the same time been indicated along which the
art of painting was proceeding during these years in other countries.</p>

<p class="center chap">CHAPTER XIII</p>

<p class="center chap2">THE HISTORICAL SCHOOL OF PAINTING IN BELGIUM</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">Belgian</span> art had gone through the same history as French art since
David. When the French patriarch came to Brussels to pass the remainder
of his days there in honour, he found the ground already well prepared.
The Classicists had long since made their way into art, and the old Flemish
tradition was dying out. Lens and Herreyns are the last colourists in the
sense of the good old time, but they are associated with the good old time only
through the qualities of their colouring. As a degenerate descendant of Van
Dyck, <i>Lens</i> painted with a feeble brush sweet, insipid, sugary work for boudoirs
and <i>prie-dieu</i> chairs; and had lost his feeling for nature to such a degree that
he gave the aged the same flesh tint as children, and men the full breasts of
hermaphrodites. <i>Herreyns</i>, appointed director of the Antwerp Academy in
1800, was more masculine; and although likewise conventional and wanting
in individuality, he was none the less a painter of breadth and boldness. He
was most enraptured with a model with a copper-coloured skin and knotted
muscles, or with pretty and ruddy children, and fat nurses with swelling
breasts. This bold worker embodied in his own person the art of a great
epoch, but did nothing to renew it. These painters, indeed, only mixed for
a new hash the crumbs fallen from the table at which giants had once sat.
They looked backwards instead of around them, and lighted their modest
little lamp at the sun of Rubens. France was the only country where art
followed the great changes of culture in the age. Hence Flemish painting
had been crossed with French elements long before David&rsquo;s arrival. And
Paris was for the artists of 1800 what Italy had been for those of 1600. They
made their pilgrimage in troops to the studio of Suvée, who had originally
come from Bruges, but had lived since 1771 on the Seine. There, and there
only, recipes for the composition of great figure pictures were to be obtained.
And thus art completed what the Empire had in a political sense begun. The
artistic barriers fell as the geographical ones had done before, and the Belgian
painters went back to Brussels, Antwerp, Ghent, and Bruges as men annexed
by France.</p>

<p>David on his arrival needed only to shake the tree and the fruit fell ripe
into his lap. He entered Flanders like a conqueror, and left the signs of
ravage behind him on his triumphal progress. In Brussels a court gathered
round him as round a banished king, and a gold medal was struck in memory of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page302" id="page302"></a>302</span>
his arrival. He took Flemish art in his powerful hands and crushed it. For,
needless to say, he saw nothing but barbarism in the genius of Rubens, and
inoculated Flemish artists with a genuine horror of their great prince of
painters. He continued to teach in Brussels what he had preached in Paris,
and became the father-in-law of a deadly tiresome Franco-Belgian school,
to which belonged a succession of correct painters; men such as Duvivier,
Ducq, Paelinck, Odevaere, and others. For the aboriginal, sturdy, energetic,
and carnal Flemish art was prescribed the mathematical regularity of the
antique canon. The old Flemish joyousness of colour passed into a
consumptive cacophony. And then was repeated in Belgium the tragedy
which Classicism had played in France. Everything became a pretext for
draperies, stiff poses, sculptural groupings, and plaster heads. Phædra and
Theseus, Hector and Andromache, Paris and Helen, were, as in Paris, the
most popular subjects. And so great a confusion reigned, that a sculptor
from whom a wolf was ordered included the history of Romulus and Remus
gratuitously.</p>

<p>The only one whose works are still partially enjoyable is <i>Navez</i>. He was,
like Ingres in France, the last prop of this art, chiselled, as it were, out of
stone; and even after the fall of Classicism he remained in esteem, because,
like Ingres, he knew how to steer a prudent course between David, the Italians,
and a certain independent study of nature. A touch of realism was mingled
with his mania for the Greeks; only to a limited extent did he correct &ldquo;ugly&rdquo;
nature; he would have ventured to represent Socrates with his negro nose
and Thersites with his hump, and, again, like Ingres he has left behind him
enduring performances as a portrait painter. His correct, cold, and discreet
talent grew warm at the touch of human personality, and his drawings, in
particular, prove that he had warmth of feeling as an artist. As his biographer
tells us, he seldom laid down the sketch-book in which he fixed his impressions
as he talked. Every page was filled with sketches of a group, a figure, or a
gesture seen in the street and rapidly dashed off, &ldquo;as realistically as even
Courbet could desire.&rdquo; And these he transferred, when he painted in the
&ldquo;noble style.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Navez had importance as an artist, so had <i>Matthias van Bree</i>&mdash;Herreyns&rsquo;
successor in the directorate of the Antwerp Academy&mdash;importance as a
teacher. He worked in Belgium, like Gros in Paris, only in another way.
While Gros as an artist was the forerunner of Romanticism, and as a teacher
an orthodox Classicist, Van Bree is tedious as an artist, but as a teacher he
fanned in the young generation a glowing love for old Flemish art. No one
spoke of Rubens, Van Dyck, and the great art of the seventeenth century with
so much warmth and understanding; and whilst with the charcoal in his
hand he composed buckram cartoons, he dreamt of a youth who should arise
to renew the old Flemish tradition.</p>

<p>Before long this young man had grown up. He had seen the artistic
treasures of Antwerp and Paris. Here Rubens had delighted his eyes, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page303" id="page303"></a>303</span>
there Paul Veronese. As he admired both in the Louvre, he heard behind
him the voice of the young Romanticists who, like him, had an enthusiasm
for colour and movement, and blasphemed the stiff, colourless old David.
<i>Gustav Wappers</i>, also, had paid toll to Classicism, and painted in 1823 a
&ldquo;Regulus&rdquo; after the well-known recipe. All the greater was the astonishment
when, in 1830, he came forward with his &ldquo;Burgomaster van der Werff&rdquo;:
&ldquo;Burgomaster van der Werff of Leyden, at the siege of the town in 1576,
offers his own body as food to the famished citizens.&rdquo; The very subject could
not fail to create enthusiasm in the great body of the people, excited as they
were by ideas of liberty: the brilliant method of presentation did this no less.
What the old Van Bree looked for, the return to the splendour of colour and
sensuous fulness of life of the old masters, was achieved in this picture. In
the same year, when Belgium had won her nationality and independence once
more, a painter also ventured to break away from the French formulæ of
Classicism, and to treat a national theme in the manner of those painters who
in former centuries had been the glory of Flanders. Wappers was greeted as
a national hero; his part it was to bring to an issue with the brush that good
fight which others had fought with the musket and sabre. His picture was
a sign of the delivery of Flemish art from the French house of bondage. Whilst
older men were horrified, as the followers of the school of Delaroche were
afterwards horrified at the &ldquo;Stone-breakers&rdquo; of Courbet, the younger generation
looked up to Wappers as a Messiah. Everything in the Brussels Salon
faded before the freshness of the new work; a springtide in painting seemed
to be at hand, and the wintry rigidity of Classicism was warmed by a burst
of sunshine, the old gods trembled and felt their Olympus quake. Gustav
Wappers was held to be the
leader of a new Renaissance. In
him the great era of the seventeenth
century was to be continued.
The iridescence of silken
stuffs, the whole colour and festal
joyousness of the old masters,
were found once more. As in
France there rose the shout, &ldquo;An
Ingres, a Delacroix!&rdquo; so there
resounded in Belgium the battle-cry,
&ldquo;A Navez, a Wappers!&rdquo;
The picture was bought by King
William <span class="sc">II</span> of Holland, and in
1832 Wappers was made Professor
of the Antwerp Academy.</p>

<p>The Exhibition of 1834 confirmed
him in his new position
as head of a school. This was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page304" id="page304"></a>304</span>
a genuine triumph, which he gained by his &ldquo;Episode in the Belgian Revolution
of 1830.&rdquo; A scene out of the blood-stained days of the street fights
in Brussels&mdash;that glorious final chapter of the struggle of the Belgian people
for freedom from the French yoke&mdash;was nothing less than an event in
which every one had recently taken part. At a period when so few realised
how closely the great masters of the past were bound to their own time and
imbibed from it their strength and nourishment, this new painter, in defiance
of all theories, had drawn boldly from life. This picture was regarded as
&ldquo;a hymn of jubilation for what was attained and a threnody for the sacrifice
it had cost.&rdquo; And the neighbourhood of the church, where he had laid the
action, stamped it almost as the votive picture of the Belgian people for its
dead. On the right an artisan standing aloft upon a newly thrown up earthwork
is reading to his attentive comrades the rejected proclamation of the
Prince of Orange. On the left a reinforcement is coming up. In the foreground
boys are tearing up the pavement or beating the drum; and here and
there are enacted various tragical family scenes. Here a young wife with a
child on her arm clings with all the strength of despair to her husband, who
resists her and finally tears himself from her grasp and hurries to the barricade&mdash;the
cry of love is drowned amid the clash of arms. There, supported on the
knee of his grey-headed father, rests a handsome young fellow with closing
eyes and the death-wound in his heart. It seems as though the Horatian
<i>dulce et decorum est</i> might be said to wander over his features and to glorify
them. For patriotism as well as for mere sentiment, here are noble scenes
enough and to spare. Not only all Brussels, but all Belgium, made a pilgrimage
to Wappers&rsquo; creation. Every mother beheld her lost son in the youth in the
foreground whose life has been sacrificed; every artisan&rsquo;s wife sought her
husband, her brother, or her father amongst the figures of the fighting-men on
the barricades. All the newspapers were full of praise, and a subscription was
set on foot to strike a medal in commemoration of the picture. If, up to this
time, Wappers had been merely praised as the renewer of Belgian art, he was
now placed alongside of the greatest masters. Thiers induced him to exhibit
in Paris the much discussed work, the fame of which had passed beyond the
boundaries of Belgium. The &ldquo;Episode&rdquo; made a triumphal tour of all the
great towns of Europe before it found its home in the Musée Moderne; and
Wappers&rsquo; fame abroad increased yet more his celebrity in Flanders. Thanks
to him, the neighbouring nations began to interest themselves in the Belgian
school. All were united in admiration of &ldquo;the mighty conception and the
harmonious scheme of colour.&rdquo; The German <i>Morgenblatt</i> published a study
of him in 1836. Wappers counted as the leading painter of his country.</p>

<p>Yet the same year brought him his first rivals. His entry on the stage had
given strength to a group of young painters belonging to the same courageous
movement, and the Brussels Salon of 1836 concentrated their efforts. <i>Nicaise
de Keyzer</i> made his appearance in heavy armour. As early as 1834 he had
come forward with a great picture, a Crucifixion, in which he desired to compete
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page305" id="page305"></a>305</span>
with Rubens, as it seemed, in the latter&rsquo;s most special province. Yet the
work merely testified to its author&rsquo;s excellent memory: the majority of the
heads, gestures, and draperies had been made use of in old pictures in precisely
the same fashion. Consciously or not, he had copied fragments direct, and
welded them together in a new composition. If, in spite of this, the name of
de Keyzer already flew from mouth to mouth, he owed it to the nimbus of
romance which irradiated his person. The story went that an Antwerp lady
on one of her walks had seen a young man drawing in the sand, while his flock
was at pasture not far off. She stepped up and offered him a pencil, and he,
a new Cimabue, began forthwith to sketch a picture of the Madonna. The
drawing was so beautiful (so the tale ran) that the lady would have held it a sin
to allow the genius to end his days as a shepherd. He came to town, received
instruction, and learned to paint. A little idyll illuminated by the amiability
of a lady was quite enough to prepare a friendly reception for De Keyzer.
And since he, like a tractable, modest young man, hearkened attentively to
criticism, he satisfied all desires when, in 1836, he came forward with his
&ldquo;Battle of the Spurs at Courtrai, 1302.&rdquo; In its quiet elegance the work
answered to the peaceful mood which prevailed once more after the days of
revolt and political insurrection. He was given special credit for clearness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page306" id="page306"></a>306</span>
of composition and antiquarian exactness. De Keyzer had chosen the moment
when the Count of Artois was expiring on the knees of a Flemish soldier;
another Fleming had his arm raised to protect his general from the approaching
French. For the rest, there is a lull in the fight, though the battlefield in the
background is indicated with the minuteness of an historian: none of those
carnages of blood and smoke of which the world was grown once more weary,
but a correct, well-disciplined battle, a skilful composition of fine gestures,
helmets, cuirasses, and halberts. Even the Count&rsquo;s spur, says Alvin, is drawn
after the original, the only remaining spur out of seven hundred which lay
scattered on the field after the day of Courtrai.</p>

<p>In the same year <i>Henri Decaisne</i> completed his &ldquo;Belges Illustres.&rdquo; The
famous past was supposed to give its blessing to the great present. The artist,
who in Paris had painted portraits with success, had been esteemed there by
Lamartine, and celebrated by Alfred de Musset in a brilliant article in the
<i>Revue des Deux Mondes</i>, now gratified a long cherished desire of the Belgian
national pride when he united the heroes of the land in an ideal gathering.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards <i>Gallait</i> and <i>Bièfve</i> trod the stage of Belgian painting. In
point of size their pictures surpassed all that that age, accustomed as it was to
vast canvases, had yet witnessed. &ldquo;The Abdication of Charles <span class="sc">V</span>&rdquo; measured
twenty feet; it was hung in the Salon Carré of the Louvre above Paul Veronese&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Marriage at Cana.&rdquo; An entire court of great ladies and gentlemen,
clad in velvet and brocade, move in the gorgeous hall of state of a king&rsquo;s castle.
The solemn moment is represented when Charles <span class="sc">V</span>, erect and dominating
the entire assembly, cedes the government of his possessions to Philip: and
here is a mine of profound criticism of the philosophy of history. This old
man, with one foot in the grave, whose forceful head still bears, like a Caryatid,
the heavy burden of empire, embodies the splendour, fame, and might of
bygone days. Faltering, he steps down from the throne, as though hesitating
at the last moment whether he should appoint as his successor this son whom
he both loves and fears; and, lifting to heaven his tired, sunken eyes, he
commends unto God the future of the realm. Philip, the only one in the
assembly entirely clothed in black, who receives the gift of dominion with an
icy coldness, is transformed by the able exegesis of the critics into the satanic
demon conjuring up the powers of hell. The picture even gives a glimpse into
the future. For as he speaks Charles leans his left hand upon the shoulder
of another young man, William of Orange. This indicates that soon the
nation will wrest their independence from the double-tongued Jesuitical policy
of Philip. To the left of this central group, robed in velvet and silk, stand
the ladies around Margaret, the sister of the Emperor; she, in the garb of a
nun, sits in her chair as in a <i>prie-dieu</i>. To the right, near the throne, are
pages and priests, and amidst them Egmont and Horn, standing aloof and
silent, look upon the scene. &ldquo;The Abdication&rdquo; had a grand success. It
confirmed the hopes which had been set on Gallait ever since the completion
of his &ldquo;Tasso,&rdquo; and it was proudly ranked amongst those works which did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page307" id="page307"></a>307</span>
special honour to the young nation. Wappers saw himself eclipsed, and
Louis Gallait took the lead.</p>

<p><i>Edouard de Bièfve&rsquo;s</i> &ldquo;Treaty of the Nobles&rdquo; formed the historical supplement
to this work; after the triumph of the kingdom came the triumph of the
people. The picture represents the signing of the defensive league, against
the Inquisition and other breaches of privilege, which the nobility of the Netherlands
entered into in 1566, in the Castle of Cuylenburg, near Brussels; it was
hailed by the <i>Berliner Staatszeitung</i> as &ldquo;a landmark in the chronicle of historical
painting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This heroic era of Belgian painting was brought to a close in 1848 by <i>Ernest
Slingeneyer</i>, who, as early as 1842, obtained a brilliant success with his &ldquo;Sinking
of the French Battleship <i>Le Vengeur</i>.&rdquo; His &ldquo;Battle of Lepanto&rdquo; was the
last great historical picture, and the entire vocabulary of admiration known
to art criticism was showered upon it by the Brussels press.</p>

<p>Even a new period of religious painting seemed about to dawn. German
art, up to that time little regarded in Belgium, had since the fifties been discussed
with considerable detail in the journals, and such names as Overbeck,
W. Schadow, Veit, Cornelius, and Kaulbach had speedily acquired a favourable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page308" id="page308"></a>308</span>
reputation. An exhibition of German cartoons instituted in Brussels in 1862
served&mdash;strangely enough&mdash;to sustain this high appreciation. The young
nation believed that it could not afford to lag behind France and Germany,
and commissioned two Antwerp painters, Guffens and Swerts, who had early
made themselves familiar with the technique of fresco, to found a Belgian
school of monumental painting. To this end they entered into a correspondence
with the German artists, and, after long studies in Italy and Germany,
adorned with frescoes the Church of Notre Dame in St. Nicolas in East Flanders,
St. George&rsquo;s Church in Antwerp, the town halls of Courtrai and Ypres, a few
churches in England, and the Cathedral of Prague; and on these frescoes
Herman Riegel, in 1883, published a book in two volumes.</p>

<p>At the present day this religious fresco painting, which handed on the
doctrine of the German Nazarenes&mdash;the doctrine that nothing remained to the
nineteenth-century artist except to imitate the old Italians as well as he could&mdash;can
no longer command such exhaustive disquisition. And not it alone:
the whole &ldquo;Belgian artistic revival of 1830&rdquo; appears in a somewhat dubious
light. After the disconsolate wilderness of Classicism this period marked an
advance. Every Salon brought some new name to light. The State had
contributed a big budget for art, and extended its protecting hand over the
&ldquo;great painting&rdquo; which was the glory of the young nation. What could not
be got into the Musée Moderne, founded in 1845, was divided amongst the
churches and provincial museums. The number of painters and exhibitions
increased very noticeably. Beside the great triennial exhibitions in Brussels,
Antwerp, and Ghent, there were others in the smaller towns, such as Mons and
Mechlin. The Belgian painters of 1830 appear, no doubt, as great men, when
one considers to what a depth art had
sunk before their advent. Wappers
especially widened the horizon, by breaking
the formula of Classicism and renewing
the tradition of the brilliant
colourists of the seventeenth century.
De Bièfve, De Keyzer, Slingeneyer,
severally contributed to the Belgian
Renaissance. The old Flemish race
knew itself once more in this fond quest
of beautiful and radiant colouring. The
historical painting had even a certain
actual interest. Standing so near to
the glorious September days when the
country won its independence, the
painters wished to draw a parallel between
the glorious present and the great
past, and to waken patriotic memories
by the apotheosis of popular heroes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page309" id="page309"></a>309</span>
And yet the Musée Moderne of Brussels is not one of those collections in
which one willingly lingers. The works in the old museum, hard by, have
remained fresh and living and in touch with us; those in the new gallery
seem to be divided from us by centuries. For the mischief with pictures
which do not remain for ever young is precisely this&mdash;they grow old so
very soon. Posterity speaks the language of cold criticism; and those
powers must be great which are even favoured with a verdict. The
luxuriant wreaths of laurel which fall upon the living are no guarantee of
enduring fame, while in the crowns awarded after death every leaf is numbered.
In how few of these once lauded works there dwells the power to speak in an
intelligible language to a generation which tests them, not for their patriotism,
but for their intrinsic art. The Belgian school of 1830 has left behind it the
trace of respectable industry, but a supreme work is what it has not brought
forth.</p>

<p>How hard it is to see anything epoch-making in Wappers&rsquo; &ldquo;Van der Werff.&rdquo;
How theatrically the figures are posturing, how improbable is the composition,
and what an unwholesome dose of sentimentality is to be found in that burgomaster,
who is offering himself as a prey to the multitude! The heads are
those of troubadours. And these jerkins brought fresh out of the wardrobe,
these neatly ironed white ruffles, all this rich velvet and glittering pomp, how
little it resembles the torn rags of a half-starved people after a nine months&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page310" id="page310"></a>310</span>
siege! His revolutionary picture of 1834 is an unfortunate transposition into
a sentimental key of the &ldquo;Freedom on the Barricades&rdquo; by Delacroix. Here
also are play-actors rather than men and women of the people. This old man
who is kissing the banner, the wife who winds her arms about her husband
as Venus does about Tannhäuser, the pale girl who has fallen in a faint, the
warrior who, with his eyes turned up to Heaven, is breaking his sword&mdash;these
are figures out of a melodrama, not revolutionaries storming the barricades,
nor famishing artisans fighting for their very existence. And the thin, spick-and-span
colouring is in just as striking a contrast with the forceful action
of the scene. An idyll could not be carried out with more prettiness of manner
than is this picture which represents the rising of a people. The artisans are
as white as alabaster. A light rouge rests upon the cheeks of the women, as
when Boucher paints the faltering of virtue. And afterwards Wappers&rsquo;
course went further and further down hill. Only in these two early works,
in which he responded to a political movement by an artistic endeavour, does
he seem, in a certain sense, individual and powerful. All the others are stereotyped
productions which, having nothing to do with the Belgian national
movement, have all the more to do with the Parisian <i>École du bon sens</i>. Even
his &ldquo;Christ in the Grave,&rdquo; painted in 1833, and now in St. Michael&rsquo;s Church
at Louvain, with its artificial grace and pietistical sentimentality, might have
been painted by Ary Scheffer. The pathetic scenes from English and French
history of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries which followed this merely
reflect that painting of historical anecdote which was invented by Delaroche.
Agnes Sorel and Charles <span class="sc">VII</span>, Abelard and Eloise, Charles <span class="sc">I</span> taking leave of
his children, Anne Bullen&rsquo;s parting from Elizabeth, Peter the Great presenting
to his ministers the model of a Dutch ship, Columbus in prison, Boccaccio
reading the <i>Decameron</i> to Joanna of Naples, the brothers De Witt before their
execution, André Chénier in the prison of Saint-Lazare, Louis <span class="sc">XVII</span> at Simon
the shoe-maker&rsquo;s, the poet Camoens as a beggar, Charles <span class="sc">I</span> going to the scaffold&mdash;all
are subjects treated by others before him in France, and neither in their
conception nor their technique have they anything original. In the last-mentioned
picture, exhibited in Antwerp in 1870, he attained the limit of
sugary affectation: a young girl has sunk on her knees, and, with dreamily
uplifted eyes, offers to the Stuart King who is going to his death&mdash;a rose!
Wappers is merely a reflex of French Romanticism, although he cannot be
brought into direct comparison with any Parisian master. The passion of
Delacroix stirred him but little: nothing points to a relationship between
him and that great spirit. One is rather reminded of Alfred Johannot, whom
he resembles in his entire gamut of emotion as in his treatment and selection
of subjects. In both may be found elegance of line, Byronic emphasis, histrionic
gestures, and the same stage properties borrowed from the theatre; never the
genuine movement of feeling, only empty and distorted grimaces.</p>

<p>Of the others who appeared with him the same may be said. All Belgian
matadors of the forties and fifties came to grief, and are interesting in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page311" id="page311"></a>311</span>
history of art only as symptomatic phenomena, as members of that school
of Delaroche which encompassed the world. They abandoned the antique
marble, the chlamys, and the leaden forms of the Classicists, to set in their
place a motley picture of the Middle Ages, made up of cuirasses, mail-shirts,
fleshings, and velvet and silken doublets. One convention followed the
other, and pedantic dryness was replaced by melancholy sentimentalism.
As skilled practitioners they understood the sleights of their art, but never
rose to individual creation. Amongst many painters there was not a single
artist.</p>

<p>As regards <i>De Keyzer</i>, it seems as if throughout his whole life he had wished
to remain true to the memory of his benefactress: a simpering feminine
trait runs with enervating sweetness through all his works, even through that
&ldquo;Battle of the Spurs&rdquo; which founded his reputation. According to old
writers, the athletic bodies of the Flemings were the terror of the French
chivalry at Courtrai. De Keyzer has made of them mere plaster figures, and
the pale, meagre colouring is in keeping with the languid conception. In the
battles of Woeringen, of Senef, and Nieuwpoort, which followed on this
picture, and were executed for the Belgian and Dutch Government, he
succeeded still less in overcoming his affectation; and he first found the
fitting province for his mild and correct talent when in later years he began
to render little anecdotes of the Emperor Maximilian or Justus Lipsius out of
the studio of Rubens or Memlinc. For these there was need of little but a
certain superficial play of colour and an elegant painting of textures.</p>

<p><i>Ernest Slingeneyer</i> is stronger and more masculine. Yet what an unrefreshing
chaos of blue, red, saffron,
and citron-yellow is that &ldquo;Sea-fight
at Lepanto&rdquo;! Slingeneyer felt that
the <i>chiaroscuro</i> with which Wappers
saturated his &ldquo;Episode&rdquo; was not in
keeping with this action under open
sky. But rightly as he felt this, he
had not the strength to solve the
problem of open-air painting. What
a barbaric effect these red, brown,
and yellow bodies make in their
motley theatrical pomp! How the
composition of the picture savours
of apotheosis! As for his later
work, his thirteen gigantic pictures,
&ldquo;<i>gloires de la Belgique</i>,&rdquo; in the great
hall of the Brussels Academy, like
De Keyzer&rsquo;s mural paintings above
the staircase of the Antwerp
Museum, they would never have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page312" id="page312"></a>312</span>
been painted had they not had Delaroche&rsquo;s hemicycle as their forerunner.</p>

<p>And <i>Gallait&rsquo;s</i> &ldquo;Abdication of Charles <span class="sc">V</span>&rdquo;&mdash;one fails to understand how it
was possible that so much able disquisition was suggested by this picture.
How slight a smattering of the erudition of a stage manager is necessary for
the representation of such a scene: the throne on one side; before it the
lords and gentlemen in a semicircle, to the left front the ladies to make a fine
effect for the eye, and in the background balconies with curious spectators,
to widen out the spectacle. It is all pure theatre; an icy ceremony with
prettily got up supernumeraries. All the heads have the discreditable
appearance of family portraits painted after death, and then washed over
with a faint conventional tinge of red. The whole thing is like a huge piece
of still-life, which an adroit painter has put together out of a mixture of heads,
gold, jewels, mantles, and perukes. Delaroche seems to have contributed
the composition, Devéria the sumptuous costumery; and as for the colouring,
Isabey, with his sunbeams shimmering in gold and silver, may not improbably
have had something to do with that. What was spontaneous in Wappers is
replaced in Gallait by cold calculation. Once and once only did this correct
and frigid painter give evidence of a certain dramatic vein; it was when in
1851 he painted &ldquo;The Brussels Guild of Marksmen paying the Last Honours
to Egmont and Horn.&rdquo; With a brutal audacity the decapitated heads are
set to their bodies. Bloodless and livid, with clotted and tangled beards,
they both really look as if they had been studied direct from nature. But
the rest of the picture, the surrounding of theatrical attractions, parade
costumes, and false pathos, is all the less in keeping with this study of death.
How Zurbaran or Caravaggio would have
treated the theme! They would have
veiled the unessential figures in darkness,
and irradiated the heads only with a
trenchant light. What Gallait has made
of it is the final tableau of an opera of
costume. The two sergeants of Alva who
are on guard, and the men who are showing
their reverence, tread the stage like
bad actors, scrupulously arrayed and making
pathetic gestures. Their action has
been studied from drawing-school copies;
no genuine cry of passion ever breaks
through. Heads, hands, and outlines have
all a sickly idealism; a studious and sedulously
polished manner of painting has
ruined the intrinsic spirit of the work as
a whole. Théophile Gautier was right
when he wrote of Gallait: &ldquo;<i>Tout le talent</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page313" id="page313"></a>313</span>
<i>qu&rsquo;on peut acquérir avec du travail, du goût, du jugememt, et de la volonté,
M. Gallait le possède.</i>&rdquo; Gallait&rsquo;s &ldquo;Last Obsequies,&rdquo; hung in that same
Salon of 1850 which contained Courbet&rsquo;s &ldquo;Stone-breakers,&rdquo; and the words
of recognition accorded to it, were the last obsequies given to the parting
genius of historical painting. A few years went by, and Gallait&rsquo;s fame died
away. After 1851 he painted fourteen other great historical pictures
(&ldquo;Egmont&rsquo;s Last Moments,&rdquo; &ldquo;Johanna the Mad by the Corpse of her
Husband,&rdquo; &ldquo;Alva at the Window during the Execution of the two Counts,&rdquo;
etc.), and, occasionally, sentimental <i>genre</i> pictures, such as &ldquo;The Oblivion of
Sorrow&rdquo; in the Berlin National Gallery; in this a small boy is playing the
fiddle for the consolation of his sister, who had sunk upon the high-road
exhausted by hunger. He also painted many portraits. But nothing gave
him a niche in the memory of his contemporaries. &ldquo;The Pest at Tournai,&rdquo;
painted in 1882, was a work extremely creditable to his old age; it was nevertheless
a picture which appeared to another generation merely as a phantom;
and when, on 20th November 1887, the announcement of his death passed
through the land, it came unexpectedly, like that of a person already believed
to have been long dead.</p>

<p>Finally, <i>Edouard de Bièfve</i>, who in 1842 shared Gallait&rsquo;s triumph in Germany,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page314" id="page314"></a>314</span>
and was afterwards named in the same breath with him, is the man who
marks the complete corruption of this tendency. If the sturdy Wappers,
the emasculate De Keyzer, and the eclectic Gallait tricked out their pathetic
heroes with noble heads like that of the Antinous, and offered their contemporaries
an adroit theatrical art, a parade, and a hollow pathos, the
incapable Bièfve never got beyond the painting of <i>tableaux vivants</i> laboriously
presented. Terrible and of Shakespearian impressiveness is the scene in
which the half-famished Ugolino hurls himself upon his son in an appalling
ecstasy of frenzy, a curse against God and man upon his lips. Upon the
canvas, six metres wide, which Bièfve in 1836 devoted to this theme, there is
represented an old gentleman, who, though certainly a little pale, contrives
to maintain in perfection the punctilious bearing of a cavalier, and in the
midst of his fasting cure has picturesquely draped round his shoulders an ermine
mantle, as if he had been asked out to dinner. Before him stands a young
man, possessing that graceful outline beloved of Paul Delaroche. Devéria,
Ary Scheffer, and Johannot were better painters of such monumental illustrations
of the classics. As yet the shivering art of Belgium had learnt only to
warm itself at the Parisian fireside. Even Bièfve&rsquo;s &ldquo;League of the Nobles of
the Netherlands,&rdquo; despite its national subject-matter, was no more than a
lucky hit, which he owed to his long residence in Paris. And how tiresomely
is the scene played out! One would wish to catch the mutterings of insurrection
from these men who personify the Belgian people; but Bièfve&rsquo;s picture is
restful and dignified. Egmont and Horn, the lions of the occasion, are
conducting themselves like honest citizens who are bored at a party. Seated
in his chair, the handsome Egmont thinks merely of showing his fine profile
to the ladies in the gallery, and Horn, who steps towards the table to make
his signature, does it with the elegance
of a lover inscribing verses in a young
lady&rsquo;s album. Three brothers with
clasped hands swear the well-known
oath to die together.</p>

<p>It is a little irony in the history of
art that in 1842 these two same pictures
set all Germany in tumult, and
diverted the whole stream of painting
into a new course. But how was it possible
that the German painters stood
before them as if struck by lightning?
It must be remembered that for a whole
generation Germany had seen nothing
but coloured cartoons, and that the
enthusiasm for Franco-Belgian art had
been so prepared that the least touch
was enough to set it in flames.</p>

<p>Since the wars of liberation Germany had been very reserved in her attitude
towards the French. Until the year 1842 original works of the French and
Belgian school had never been hung in any German exhibition. But in spite
of this, a high, even enthusiastic, appreciation of French and Belgian painting
was being spread, especially amongst the younger generation. Even in
engravings and lithographs after French pictures it was believed that qualities
of colour were discoverable which were wanting in German painting. Heine
and other authors, who had wandered to Paris, &ldquo;the lofty tower of Freedom,&rdquo;
to escape from the depressing condition of German affairs, had done what in
them lay for the dissemination of this cult. The rising generation of the
forties had been driven by Heine&rsquo;s notices of the Salon into an almost hostile
attitude towards the dominant art schools of Germany, the schools of Düsseldorf
and Munich. The stylists on the Isar and the sentimental elegiac painters
on the Rhine met with the same antipathy from the younger generation. The
appearance of the two Belgian historical pictures, which were really nothing
more than offshoots of the great French school, gave nourishment of doubled
strength to this tendency to seek salvation in Paris. The German painters
were startled out of contentment with their beloved cartoons, and to many
a man it seemed as if the scales had fallen from his eyes. They perceived
what an admirable thing it is that a painter should be able to paint. What
they could have learnt long before from any good old picture, and in their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page316" id="page316"></a>316</span>
turbulent enthusiasm for ideas had not learnt, was made suddenly clear to them
by these new paintings. They came to the conclusion that it was impossible
for God Almighty to have poured light and colour over the objective world
with the intention that painters should transform it into a world of shadowless
contours. They recognised that the style of cartoon work had led away from
all painting, and that it was therefore necessary to do honour once more to
the despised handiwork and technique of art, as the fundamental condition
of its well-being. However much the æsthetic party might warn them not
to renounce &ldquo;the Reformation of painting, which had been begun and perfected
forty years before,&rdquo; and not &ldquo;with modern technique to sink back
into the pre-Cornelian, ornamental model painting,&rdquo; the demand for colour,
which had been so long neglected, asserted its rights more and more loudly.
King Ludwig&rsquo;s saying was repeated as though it were a new revelation: &ldquo;The
painter must be able to paint.&rdquo; Colour was the battle-cry of the day, the
battle-cry of youth, to whom the world belongs. In place of the ideal of
contour came the ideal of hue and pigment. Cartoons, in the sense of the
old cartoon school, no one would draw any longer. To paint pictures, finished
pictures, was the tendency of the day. And since painting is to be learnt
from the living only, and such as could paint lived in Germany no longer,
they packed their trunks, and set out to learn from the &ldquo;go-ahead neighbour.&rdquo;
As Rome had been hitherto, so was Paris now, the high school of German art.
&ldquo;To Paris!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Painting!&rdquo; were the cries throughout all Germany.</p>

<p class="center chap2">THE REVOLUTION OF THE GERMAN COLOURISTS</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">From</span> 1842 dates the pilgrimage of the German artists to Paris, Antwerp,
and Brussels. In Delaroche, Cogniet, and Couture, in Wappers and
Gallait, they believed they could discover the secrets of art which were hidden
from German teachers. The history of art can scarcely offer another example
of such a sudden overthrow of dogmas hitherto dominant by dogmas directly
opposed to them. During the first half of the century the painters of Germany
were pious men, humorous, witty, and intelligent men; they had a sharply
cut profile, and so enchained the multitude by their human qualities that
nobody remarked how little they understood of their craft, or that they were
too superior to learn to draw correctly, held colour unchaste, and made virtues
of all their failings. The next generation was condemned to learn painting
during the whole of its natural life. The former were &ldquo;problematic natures&rdquo;:
beings who united with a Titanic force of will an actual achievement which is
hardly worth mentioning; who regarded the mere handicraft of art as beneath
their dignity; who, in their revelations to mankind, were resolved to burden
their spirit as little as possible with any sensuous expression of their genius,
and, above all, meant not to degrade themselves by the manual labour of
learning to paint, and thereby wasting their valuable time. The latter were
not ashamed of painting. By devoting themselves with vehemence to the
colouring and technique of oil-painting, they accomplished the necessary
revolution against the abstract idealism of the school of Cornelius. In their
opulence of ideas the draughtsmen of cartoons had made a notch in the history
of art by casting the technical tradition overboard. To have reinstated this
as far as they could, with the aid of the French, is the peculiar merit of the
generation of 1850. &ldquo;<i>Règle générale: si vous rencontrez un bon peintre allemamd,
vous pouvez le complimenter en français.</i>&rdquo; So runs the motto&mdash;not complimentary
to Germany, but quite unassailable&mdash;which Edmond About prefixed to
his notices on the Paris Universal Exhibition of 1855.</p>

<tr><td class="captionx">ANSELM FEUERBACH.&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;PORTRAIT OF HIMSELF.</td></tr></table>

<p><i>Anselm Feuerbach</i> was the first distinguished German artist who made the
journey to Paris with a proper knowledge of the necessity of this step. In
Germany he was the greatest representative of that Classicism of which the
principal master in France was Ingres, and the continuator Thomas Couture.
And he succeeded in accomplishing that which the German Classicists of the
beginning of the century strove after in vain. Whilst they contented themselves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page318" id="page318"></a>318</span>
with suggestions and an indeterminate symbolisation of poetical ideas
after the Greek writers, German Classicism achieved in Feuerbach&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Symposium of Plato&rdquo; a great, noble, and faultless work, which will live.
He moved upon classic ground more naturally and freely and with more of
the Hellenic spirit than even the French. For the classic genius was begotten
in him, and not inoculated from without. In the <i>Vermächtniss</i> the son calls
his father&rsquo;s book the prophetic seal of his own original being. He inherited
the classic spirit from the enthusiastic scholar, the subtile author of the
Vatican Apollo, to whom the genius of Greece had so fully and completely
revealed itself.</p>

<p>A remarkable nature: philologer and dreamer, German and Greek, one
who rejoiced in beauty and in the life of the senses, and whose proud muse
strayed through life solitary and with leaden weights upon her feet,&mdash;such
was Anselm Feuerbach, and by that division of his being he was
ruined. Equipped with a superior education, an appearance of singular
nobility, and with proud family traditions, he emerged like a shining
meteor in Düsseldorf, when he began his career at the age of sixteen,
brilliant, precocious, and already a favourite amongst women. This
was in 1845. He ran through all the schools in Germany, Belgium,
and France. In regard to
the living, he believed himself
to be indebted to the
French alone, and eagerly
claimed the merit of having
been the first to seek them
out. But it was in Italy that
he had passed through his
novitiate as an artist. A
glorious hour it must have
been when Feuerbach, full-blooded
and dedicated to the
worship of beauty, entered
Venice in 1855, in company
with that cheerful and convivial
poet Victor Scheffel.
In the town of the lagoons,
whither he had come on a
commission from the Court
of Karlsruhe to copy the
Assumption of Titian, Feuerbach
made the second determining
step of his life. The
third he made when his
stipendium was withdrawn,
and, full of youthful confidence in his luck and his good star, he undertook
his journey to Rome.</p>

<p>He was handsome, small, and refined, and rather pale and spare&mdash;of that
delicacy which in highly bred families is found in the last heirs with whom
the race dies out&mdash;and he had dark locks which clustered wildly round his
head. The moulding of his features was feminine, and his complexion
southern; his eyes, shadowed by long lashes, were brown, sometimes fiery,
sometimes sad and earnest, and his glance was swift. He loved to sing Italian
songs to the guitar in his fine, deep voice, and Boecklin and Reinhold Begas
would join in.</p>

<p>The impressions he received in Italy were formative of his life. For he
learnt to understand the divine simplicity and noble dignity of antique art
better than Couture was capable of understanding them; and he achieved a
simple amplitude to which the French Classicism had never risen.</p>

<p>From his first works, to which the Düsseldorf egg-shell is still sticking,
down to the &ldquo;Symposium of Plato&rdquo;&mdash;what a route it is, and through what
phases he passes. &ldquo;Hafiz at the Well,&rdquo; surrounded by voluptuous, half-naked
girls, painted at Paris in 1852, was his first eminent achievement. In
subject it is a late fruit from Daumer&rsquo;s study of Hafiz: as a work of art it is
one of the most genuine products of the school of Couture. No other German
artist has surrendered himself so entirely to the French. With a large brush,
never losing sight of the complete effect, Feuerbach has painted his canvas,
almost for the sake of showing that he has assimilated everything that was
to be learnt in Paris. The same influence preponderates in the &ldquo;Death of
Pietro Aretino,&rdquo; done in 1854. But, side by side with the Parisian master,
the later Venetians have an unmistakable share in this work. The capacity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page322" id="page322"></a>322</span>
to grasp things in a monumental largeness is already announced. Evidently
Feuerbach has studied Paul Veronese, and realised how high he stands above
the French painters. At the same time he has examined the other Venetians
for their technique, and discovered something which has appealed to him
in Bordone&rsquo;s colouring. But &ldquo;Dante walking with high-born Ladies of
Ravenna,&rdquo; finished at Rome in 1857, was the ripest fruit of his Venetian
impressions. In sunny warmth of colour, fine golden tone, and quiet simplicity
of pictorial treatment, no modern has come so near to Palma and Bordone.
And in &ldquo;Dante&rsquo;s Death,&rdquo; of 1858, there predominates a still greater depth
and golden glow, a
grave and devout
beauty.</p>

<p>In the following
works, however, Feuerbach,
with a conscious
purpose, denies
himself the quality
to which the Dante
pictures owe a principal
part of their
powerful effect: the
mild glow, the sunny
beaming of colour.
He confines himself
to a cool scheme of
tone, reduced to grey,
almost to the point
of colourlessness; to
a glimmer of leaden
blue, a moonlight
pallor. At the same
time he has concentrated
the whole life
of his figures in their
inward being, whilst
every movement has
been taken from their
limbs. Even the expression
of spiritual
emotion in the eyes
and features has been
subdued in the extreme.
The &ldquo;Pietà,&rdquo;
both the &ldquo;Iphigenias,&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page323" id="page323"></a>323</span>
and the &ldquo;Symposium
of Plato&rdquo; are the world-renowned
proofs of the
height of classic inspiration
which he touched in Italy.
Measure, nobility, unsought
and perfected loftiness characterise
the &ldquo;Pietà,&rdquo; that
mother of the Saviour who
bows herself in silent agony
over the body of her Divine
Son, and those three kneeling
women, whose silent grief is
of such thrilling power, precisely
because of its emotionlessness.
For &ldquo;Iphigenia&rdquo;
Feuerbach has given of his
best. She is in both examples&mdash;the
first of 1862, the second
of 1871&mdash;a figure sublime beyond
human measure, grand
like the figure of the Greek
tragedy. But the &ldquo;Symposium
of Plato&rdquo; will always
assert its high value as one of
the finest pictorial creations of an imagination nourished on the great art of the
ancients, and filled brimful with the splendour of the antique world. There is
nothing in it superfluous, nothing accidental. The noblest simplicity of speech,
a Greek rhythm in all gradations, the beautiful lines of bas-relief, decisive
colour and stringent form&mdash;that is the groundwork of Feuerbach&rsquo;s art. And
through it there speaks a spirit preoccupied with greatness and heroism. Thus
he created his &ldquo;Medea&rdquo; in the Munich Pinakothek, that picture of magnificent,
sombre melancholy that affects one like a monologue from a Sophoclean
tragedy. Thus he painted his &ldquo;Battle of the Amazons,&rdquo; one of the few
&ldquo;nude&rdquo; pictures of the century which possesses the perfectly unconcerned
and unsexual nudity of the antique. Italy had set him free from all the
insincere and calculated methods which had deformed French art since
Delaroche; it had set him free from all theatrical sentiment, by which he
had accustomed himself to understand everything that was forced in costume,
pigment, pose and movement, light and scenery. In the place of the ordinary
treatment from the model, with its set gestures and grimaces, he gave an
expression of form which was great, simple, and plastic. His study seems to
have been an incessant exercise of the eye, to see and to hold fast to the
essential, to the great lines of nature as of the human body.</p>

<p>In the full possession of these powers, which he acquired amid the elementary
simplicity and heroic majesty of Roman landscape by constant
intercourse with the great painters of the past, he determined in the summer
of 1873 to accept an invitation from the Vienna Academy. His friends
rejoiced. At last this worker, who had been abandoned in a foreign land,
seemed to have found in his native country a place which offered him a new
life. He was but little more than forty: yet all was so soon to be over. From
Rome he came to the restless capital which had just lived through the birththroes
of a new epoch; from the side of Michael Angelo to the side of Makart!
The sketches for a series on the wars of the Titans, which he began after his
arrival, promised the greatest things. They display a sureness and majesty
which find no parallel in the German art of those years. But they were
destined never to be completed.</p>

<p>Feeling himself, like Antæus, strong only on Roman soil, he lost his power
in Vienna. Reserved, innately delicate, a mystical, ideal nature like that
of Faust, and one which only with reluctance permitted to a stranger a glimpse
of its inner being; in his life, as in his art, high-bred and simple, hating both
as painter and as man everything overstrained or sentimental; in his judgment
harsh, severe, and uncompromising, lonely and proud, he was but little
adapted to make friends for himself. The indifference with which his study
for the &ldquo;Fall of the Titans&rdquo; was received in the Vienna Exhibition wounded
him mortally. Vienna, which is so much disposed to laughter, laughed.
Criticism was rough and unfavourable. He left Vienna and went to Venice.
The tragical fate of a party of voyagers, drowned as they were playing and
singing together on a night journey to the Lido, gave him the motive
for his last picture, &ldquo;The Concert,&rdquo; which was found unfinished after
his death, and came into the possession of the Berlin National Gallery. On
4th January 1882 he died, alone in a Venetian hotel.</p>

<p>However, one must not go too far. In familiar conversation Feuerbach
once said of himself that when the history of art in the nineteenth century
came to be written, mention would be made of him as of a meteor. So
isolated, and so much out of connection with the artistic striving of his contemporaries,
did he believe himself to be, that he held himself justified in
saying: &ldquo;Believe me, after fifty years my pictures will possess tongues, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page325" id="page325"></a>325</span>
tell the world what I was and what I meant.&rdquo; In truth, he owes his resurrection
less to his pictures than to the <i>Vermächtniss</i>. A book has opened the
eyes of Germany to Feuerbach&rsquo;s greatness, and since that time the worship
of Feuerbach has gone almost into extremes. Throughout his lifetime&mdash;like
almost every great artist who has died before old age&mdash;he was handled by
the Press without much comprehension. The critics blamed his grey tones,
the connoisseurs complained of his unpatriotic subjects or missed the presence
of anecdote. His admirers were the refined, quiet people who do not praise
at the top of their voices. He never met with recognition, and that poisoned
his life. It is generous of posterity to make up for the want of contemporary
appreciation. But when he is set up as a pioneer, whose work pointed
out the art of the future, the judgment becomes one which a <i>later</i> posterity
will subscribe to only with hesitation.</p>

<p>Feuerbach presents a problem for psychological rather than artistic
analysis. Whoever has read the <i>Vermächtniss</i> feels the personal element in
these works, sees in them the confessions of a proud, unsatisfied, and suffering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page326" id="page326"></a>326</span>
soul, and in their author no son of the Renaissance born out of due season,
but a modern who has been agitated through and through by the <i>décadent</i>
fever. In his book Feuerbach appears as one of the first who felt to his inmost
fibre all the intellectual and spiritual contradictions which are bred by the
nineteenth century, and who cherished them even with a sort of tenderness,
as contributing to a high and more subtilised condition of soul. He was one
of the first who, in the same way as Bourget and Verlaine, studied moral
pathology under the microscope, and who, with a tired soul and worn-out
feelings, sought for the last refinement of simplicity. And this weary resignations
seems also to speak from his pictures. Not one of the old painters has
this modern melancholy, this air of dejection which hovers over his works.
Even the ladies round Dante are filled with that sadness which comes over
youth on the evenings of sultry summer days, when it is struck by a presentiment
of the transitoriness of earthly things. It is as if these figures would all
some day or other vanish into the cloister, or, like Iphigenia, sit lonely upon
the shore of a sea, whither no ship should ever come to release them. And it
is certainly not by chance that Iphigenia had such a hold upon the artist; he
repeatedly set himself to render her figure afresh, and, later, Medea steps
beside her as the impersonation of the still more intense sense of desertion
which filled the artist&rsquo;s spirit. The woman of Colchis, who sits shivering on
the shore of the sea, chilled through and through by the consciousness of her
abandonment; the daughter of Agamemnon, who in spirit is seeking the land
of the Greeks, with the boundless sea spreading wide and grey before her, like
her own yearning,&mdash;both are images of the lonely Feuerbach, who, like
Hölderlin, the Werther of Greece, flies to a dreamy Hellas as to a happy
shore, to find peace for his sick spirit. His &ldquo;Symposium of Plato&rdquo; has not
that exuberant sensuousness, that mixture of <i>esprit</i> and voluptuousness, of
temperance and intemperance, which marks the Athenian life under
Pericles; nor has it the Olympian blitheness with which Raphael would
have executed the subject. A breath of monkish asceticism is over every
joy, subduing it. These Greeks have tasted of the pains which Christianity
brought into the world. Or take his &ldquo;Judgment of Paris&rdquo; in Hamburg.
Nude women life-size, Loves, southern landscape, gay raiment, golden vessels,
brilliant ornament, beauty&mdash;those are the elements of the picture; and
how little have such words the power to render the impression! But
Feuerbach&rsquo;s three goddesses have an uneasiness, as if each one of them knew
beforehand that she would not receive the apple; Paris is sitting just
as cheerlessly there. And by borrowing his loves from Boucher, Feuerbach
has shown the more sharply the opposition between the Hellenic legend
which he interprets and the funereal mien with which he does it. The blitheness
of the antique spirit is tempered by the sadness of the modern mind. He
tells these old myths as never a Greek and never a master of the Renaissance
would have told them. Olympus is filled with mist, with the colouring of the
North, with the melancholy of a later and more neurotic age, the moods of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page327" id="page327"></a>327</span>
which are for that very reason more rich in <i>nuances</i>&mdash;an age which is at once
graver and more disturbed by problems than was the old Hellas. Feuerbach&rsquo;s
pictures are octaves in the language of Tasso, but of a repining lyrical mood
which Tasso would not have given them. The brightest sunshine laughed
over the Greece of the Renaissance; over that of Feuerbach there rests a rainy,
overcast November mood. Even works of his like the &ldquo;Children on the Sea-shore&rdquo;
and the &ldquo;Idyll&rdquo; reveal a pained and suffering conception of nature,
that tender and subdued spirit that Burne-Jones has; it is as if these blossoms
of humanity were there to waste away in buds that never come to fruition,
as if it were no longer possible to breathe into creation the true joyousness of
youth. Even the five girls, making music out of doors, in the picture &ldquo;In
Spring,&rdquo; look like young widows, putting the whole tenderness of their souls
into elegiac complaints for their lost husbands.</p>

<p>To this resigned and mournful expression must be added the uncomfortable
motionlessness of his figures. They do not speak, and do not laugh, and do
not cry; they know no passions and sorrows which express themselves by the
straining of the limbs. Everything bears the impress of sublime peace, of
that same peace by which the works of Gustave Moreau, Puvis de Chavannes,
and Burne-Jones are to be distinguished from the ecstatic and sentimental
tirades of the Romanticists. In Feuerbach&rsquo;s works this is the stamp of his
own nature. The antique beauty becomes shrouded in a mysterious veil;
and life is illuminated as by a mournful light, which rests over bygone worlds.
What heart-rending keenness is often in the effect of the melancholy tinge
of these subdued bluish tones! That colour is the genuine expression of the
temperament reveals itself clearly enough in Feuerbach. When he began his
career, his head full of ideals and his heart full of hopes, his pictures exulted
in a Venetian splendour, in full and luxuriant golden harmonies; as &ldquo;joy after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page328" id="page328"></a>328</span>
joy was shipwrecked in the stream of time&rdquo; they became leaden, sullen, and
corpse-like. As Frans Hals in his last days, when his fellow-creatures allowed
him only the bare necessities of life, accorded to the figures in his pictures
only so much colour as would give them the appearance of living human
beings; as Rembrandt&rsquo;s magical golden tone changed in the sad days of his
bankruptcy into a sullen, monotonous brown, so a deep sadness broods over
the pictures of Feuerbach,&mdash;something that savours of memory and remorse,
the mournful atmosphere and dark mood of evening which the bat loves.
Even as a colourist he has the melancholy lassitude of the end of the century.</p>

<p>That is what distinguishes him from his contemporaries. The other
idealists of those years painted their pictures without hesitation and with
the facility of a professor of calligraphy; they remembered, arranged their
reminiscences, and rubbed their hands with self-complacency when they came
near their model. They did not yet feel the throb of the nineteenth century,
and impersonality was their note. Feuerbach, the neurotic brooder, was a
personality. After a long mortification, the human spirit, the living, suffering,
human spirit, celebrated its renaissance in his works. Under its influence
the jejune painting of prettiness practised by others was changed to modern
pessimism and sorrowful resignation. The more he gave way to these moods
the more modern he became, the more he was Feuerbach and the further he
departed from the works of art which were regarded by his contemporaries
and himself as eternal exemplars. He has been reproached with oddities
and strange eccentricities. The critics reminded him how far he departed from
the lines of his models; indignantly they asked him why he, the pale, delicate,
sick, neurotic, and overstrained man, the uncertain, faltering, and tortured
spirit, did not paint like the blithe, improvising Raphael, like the jubilant and
convivial Veronese, like the sensuous, exuberant Rubens. And Feuerbach
himself becomes perplexed. Like Gros in France, he is conscious both of his
strength and his weakness. He does not stand sovereign above the old painters,
like Boecklin and those other idealists of the present. He runs through life
in ever fresh astonishment at the novelty which is revealed to him in the
works of earlier centuries. The nerves of this latter day vibrate, the blood
of the nineteenth century throbs in him&mdash;yet he has the wish to imitate. The
history of every one of his works is a fight, a desperate struggle, between the
individuality of the artist, his own inward feeling, and the &ldquo;absolute Beauty&rdquo;
which hovered beyond him cold and unpliable.</p>

<p>In his first drawings he begins boldly; one knows his hand and says:
&ldquo;Only Feuerbach can have done that.&rdquo; And then one is able to trace, step
by step, and from sketch to sketch, what pains he takes that the finished
picture may be as little of a Feuerbach as possible. The personal and individual
element in the drawings is lost, what is Feuerbachian in the composition, the
personal contribution of the artist, is effaced, and finally there is produced in
the picture the marvellous look of having been painted by a genuine old Venetian
as a ghost. And Feuerbach felt the dissonance. He feels that he fully
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page329" id="page329"></a>329</span>
expresses himself no more, and also that he does not reach the level of the
old masters. He adds borrowed, conventional figure, like the Boucher Cupids
in the &ldquo;Judgment of Paris&rdquo;&mdash;figures against which every fibre of his being
revolts&mdash;just to arrive at an outward resemblance to the old pictures, an
impression of exultation and joyousness and the spirit of the Renaissance.
And when he stands opposite his work he seems to himself like a gravedigger
in a harlequin&rsquo;s jacket. He scrutinises himself in despair, and one day comes
to feel that his power of production is exhausted. Splendid and unapproachable,
from the walls of the galleries, the art of the classic masters stares him
in the face; and he enters into a dramatic life-and-death struggle with it.
He will not be Feuerbach, and cannot become a Classic. The curtain falls
and the tragedy is over. Such destinies have been before in the world, no
doubt; but in our time they have multiplied, and seem so much the sadder
because they never come to the average man, but only to great and peculiarly
gifted natures.</p>

<p>These matters&mdash;a silent historical sermon&mdash;one reads, with the help of the
<i>Vermächtniss</i>, out of Feuerbach&rsquo;s works. There &ldquo;his pictures possess tongues&rdquo;;
there comes out of them a sound like the cry of a human heart; the whole
tragedy of his career becomes present&mdash;what he succeeded in doing and what
remained unapproachable. Yet later generations, which will judge him no
longer psychologically, but only as an artist, generations with which he no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page330" id="page330"></a>330</span>
longer stands in touch through his ethical greatness, will they also feel this in
the presence of his finished pictures? To them will he be pioneer or imitator,
forerunner or continuator? Will he take his place by Boecklin and Watts,
or by Couture and Ingres? It is perhaps a happy chance that in the history
of art one sometimes stumbles upon personalities that mock at all chemical
analysis. Feuerbach, at any rate, is a great figure in the German art of these
years. His is a high-bred, aristocratic art, free from any illustrative undertone,
and from loud and motley colour. It is true that his figures also pose, but
never clumsily or without expression, never theatrically. At a time when
declamation was universal he did not declaim, at least he never did so with
a forced pathos; and it is principally this which gives him a very high and
special place amongst the German painters of the transitional period. He is
always simple, grave, majestic. Everything that he does has style, and that
makes him so peculiar in an art which is so often petty.</p>

<p>But a different judgment is formed when one compares him with the French
and the old masters. A meteor Feuerbach was not; for he stood on the ground
of the Couture school, and raised himself later to yet greater simplicity, going
back to purer sources, to the Venetians and the Romans. He is more austere
and manly than Couture, but he is, as he stands in his finished pictures, a Roman
of the Cinquecento, who has been in Venice; not an original genius of the
nineteenth century, like Boecklin. Boecklin paints the antique figures in their
eternal fulness and youth; but he is quite modern in sentiment and in his
highly developed technique. Feuerbach in regard to technique stands now on
French soil, now on Venetian or Roman; and in his sentiment he is an imitator
of the Cinquecentists, or, if you will, a phenomenon of atavism. His writings
and drawings show him concerned with the present, his paintings with the past.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page331" id="page331"></a>331</span>
The modern temperament, artistically restrained, breaks out no more, the
nerves have no rôle, no human sound is forced from his figures. He learnt
through the spectacles of the great old masters to look away from everything
petty in life, but he never laid those spectacles down. This modern man, who
was so neurotic as a writer, sought as a painter, for the sake of the ideal, to
have no nerves at all. Before many of his pictures one wishes for a fire; they
make an effect so cold that one shivers. The quality in them which calls for
boundless admiration is his splendid artistic earnestness. There speaks out of
them a sacred peace. Yet, when he is set up as a pioneer, it must never be
forgotten that he is not self-sufficient as, shall we say, Millet, but has attained
his majesty of conception only in the leading-strings of masterpieces of a great
period, and precisely in the leading-strings of those masterpieces from the
numbing influence of which modern art was forced to set itself free, before it
could come to the consciousness of itself.</p>

<p>Together with Feuerbach&mdash;and having, like him, previously received
enlightenment as to colouring at the Antwerp Academy&mdash;<i>Victor Müller</i>, of
Frankfort, had gone to Couture in 1849. He resided until 1858 on the banks
of the Seine, and was especially influenced by Delacroix, and perhaps also a
little affected by Courbet.
At least his &ldquo;Wood
Nymph&rdquo;&mdash;a voluptuous
woman lying in a wood&mdash;which
first made him known
in Germany in 1863, seems
but little removed from the
healthy realism and exuberant
vigour of the master
of Ornans. Otherwise, like
Delacroix, he has occupied
himself almost exclusively
with Shakespeare. &ldquo;Hamlet
at the Grave of Yorick,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Ophelia,&rdquo; &ldquo;Romeo and
Juliet,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hero and Leander,&rdquo;
were pictures of a
deep, sonorous glow of
colour; the characters in
them were seized with great
intellectual concentration,
and the surrounding landscape
filled with that sombre
poetry of nature which
in the hands of Delacroix
so mystically heightens the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page332" id="page332"></a>332</span>
impression of human tragedies. Victor Müller was of a bold, uncompromising
talent, full of southern glow and wild Romanticism; a powerful,
forcible realist, who never sought the empty, sentimental, ideal beauty known
to his age. In a period dominated almost from end to end by a jejune and
rounded beauty, he gives pleasure by a healthy, refreshing &ldquo;ugliness.&rdquo; All the
heads in his pictures were painted after nature with a religious devoutness;
painted by a man who openly loved the youthful works of Riberas and Caravaggio.
And just as surprising is the power of expression, the deep and
earnest sentiment, which he attained in gestures and physiognomy. While
Makart, in his balcony scene from <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, never got away from a
hollow, theatrical affectation, Müller&rsquo;s picture glows throughout with a sensuous
passion that saps the blood. A new Delacroix seemed to have been born;
an extraordinary talent seemed to be rising above the horizon of our art,
but Germany had to follow to the grave her greatest offshoot of Romanticism
before he had spoken a decisive word, just as she lost Rethel, the greatest
son of the cartoon era, in the flower of his age.</p>

<p>Of the others who made the pilgrimage to Paris with Feuerbach and
Müller, not one has a similar importance as an artist. Their merit was that
they made themselves comparatively able masters of technique, and taught
the new gospel when they returned to Germany. To their superiority in
technique and colour, given them by a sound French schooling, they owed
their brilliant success in the fifties. They were, at the time, the best German
painters, and great at a time when ability was novel and infrequent. As
soon as it became customary and commonplace, there remained little to raise
them above the average.</p>

<p>That is true of the entire Berlin school of the fifties and sixties. The most
independent of the many artists who
journeyed from the Spree to the Seine is,
probably, <i>Rudolf Henneberg</i>, who died
young. His technique he owed to Couture,
in whose studio he worked from 1851, and
his subject-matter to the German classical
authors. Born a Brunswicker, he felt himself
specially attracted by his countryman
Bürger, and became a Northern ballad
painter with French technique. Movement,
animation, wildness, and a certain
romantic eeriness, proper to the Northern
ballad&mdash;these are Henneberg&rsquo;s prominent
features, as they are Bürger&rsquo;s. His pictures
have a bold caprice and a peculiarly
powerful and sombre poetry. The hunting
party storm past irresistibly, like a
whirlwind, in his &ldquo;Wild Hunt,&rdquo; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page333" id="page333"></a>333</span>

<p class="noind">A Düsseldorfian Romanticism, from the Wolf&rsquo;s Glen, is united to Couture&rsquo;s
nobleness of colouring in his &ldquo;Criminal from Lost Honour,&rdquo; of 1860. And

Knight, Death, and the Devil&rdquo; lives in his masterpiece &ldquo;The Race for
Fortune,&rdquo; a picture breathed on by the spirit of sombre, mediæval Romanticism,
which made his name the most honoured in the Exhibition of 1868.</p>

<p>The negation of power, an almost feminine painter of no distinctive
character, a new edition of Winterhalter, was <i>Gustav Richter</i>. His popularity
is connected with the fisher-boys and odalisques, the reproduction of
which every sempstress at one time used to wear on her brooch, while in
printed colours they added splendour to all the bonbon and handkerchief
boxes. The accomplished workmanship and sparkling treatment of material
which he acquired in Paris made him in 1860, after Eduard Magnus had
made his exit, the most famous painter of feminine beauty. A pleasure-loving
man of the world, elegant in appearance, fame, honour, and distinction were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page334" id="page334"></a>334</span>
showered upon him, and he became the shining spoilt darling of society, the
central point of an extensive and animated convivial intercourse. His works
were carried out in a style which, at that time, had not been learnt in Berlin,
and had an air of Court life which was held to be exceedingly fashionable. It
was later that the banal emptiness and insipid taste of his toilette portraits
first became obvious, and that their everlastingly sweet and doll-like smirk,
and their kind and winning eyes, always the same, began to grow tiresome. In
all his life-size chromolithographs there is a distinction of build and appearance,
which in the originals was perhaps to have been desired, although the originals
unquestionably looked like something that was more human and individual.
In riper years, after the happiness of family life had been given him, he executed
works which assure his name a certain endurance; this he did in some
of his family portraits,&mdash;for instance, in those of his boys and his wife. To this
last period belongs the ideal portrait of the Baroness Ziegler as Queen Louisa,
which became such a popular picture in Prussia. But Richter&rsquo;s &ldquo;great&rdquo;
compositions, which once charmed the visitors at exhibitions, are now forgotten.
In &ldquo;Jairus&rsquo;s Daughter&rdquo;&mdash;admired in 1856 as a fine performance in
colouring&mdash;what strikes one now that its colouring has long been surpassed
is the inadequacy and theatricality of its characterisation, the outward show,
and the banality of this handsome young man who performs his miracle with
a declamatory pose. The &ldquo;Building of the Pyramids,&rdquo; painted for the Maximilianeum
in Munich, with its swarming crowd of dark-coloured people, and
the royal pair come to inspect with an endless train, is a gigantic ethnographical
picture-sheet, which did not repay the expenditure of twelve long
years of work.</p>

<p>In Paris <i>Otto Knille</i> learnt to approach huge canvas and wall spaces with
fearlessness, and by executing the many monumental commissions which fell
to his share in Prussia, he put this French talent to usury in a manner which
was as blameless as it was uninteresting. Some good paintings by <i>Julius
Schrader</i>, such as the historical pictures with which his fame is associated,
have remained fresh for a longer period. The &ldquo;Death of Leonardo da Vinci,&rdquo;
as well as the &ldquo;Surrender of Calais to Edward <span class="sc">III</span>,&rdquo; &ldquo;Wallenstein and Seni
at their Astrological Studies,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Dying Milton,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Charles <span class="sc">I</span> parting
from his Children,&rdquo; are only a collection of what the Parisian studios had
transmitted to him. Delaroche and the illustrative and theatrical painting of
history, having gone the rounds in Belgium, in the next decade demanded
their sacrifice in Germany.</p>

<p>Here also similar political and literary conditions were prescribed. A
backward people, uncontent with itself, pined for deeds and glory. Through
the presentment of the great dramas of the past the spirit of the present was
to be quickened, as a relaxed body by massage. Here also the knowledge of
history levelled the ground for painting, as it did in France. While, in the
imagination of the Romanticists, different ages melted dreamily into each
other, and the Hohenstauffen period, because of its tender melancholy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page335" id="page335"></a>335</span>
character, gave the keynote for all German history, the scientific writing of
history had, since the thirties, entered as a power into literature. Schlosser
began his <i>Universal-historische Uebersicht der Geschichte der alten Welt</i>, which
swelled to nine volumes, and represented with a completeness hitherto unapproached
the civilisation of antiquity. His history of the eighteenth century
was a still greater departure, for, after the example of Voltaire, he
included manners, science, and literature in his account of political events.
On the uncompromising subjectivity of Schlosser followed the scientific
objectivity of Ranke, who, a master of the criticism of sources, delineated
with delicate, silver-point portraits the Papacy after the Reformation, the
French Court, the policy of the princes of the age of the Reformation, Cromwell,
and the heroes of the rising power of Prussia. Luden, Giesebrecht, Leo, Hurter,
Dahlmann, Gervinus, and many others began their great labours. German
painting, like French, sought to take advantage of the results of these scientific
investigations; and Schnaase was the first who, in the <i>Kunstblatt</i> in 1834,
described historical painting as the pressing demand of the age, and the
cultivation of the historical sense in such a disconsolate epoch as a &ldquo;truly
religious necessity.&rdquo; Soon afterwards Vischer began to preach historical
painting as a new gospel. History, he says, is the revelation of God. His
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page336" id="page336"></a>336</span>
Being is revealed in it as much as in the sacred writings of religion. Historical
painting is therefore the completion and full exemplification of those principles
which, five centuries back, in Giotto, led to the movement of the new Christian
painting. It is called forth by the development of all forms of life and
knowledge, and is the last and highest step which sacred painting is able to
reach: it is the final completion of sacred painting itself. &ldquo;Who represents
the Holy Ghost with more dignity? He who paints Him as a dove upon a
sheaf of sunbeams, or he who places before me a great and lofty man, a Luther
or a Huss in the flame of divine enthusiasm?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Something of the sort had been in the mind of Strauss when he advocated
the worship of genius as a substitute for religion. The infidel idealistic painting
and satire had been followed by a religious art which evaporated in Nazareanism;
pure history in boots and spurs was next preached as a religion. &ldquo;We
stand,&rdquo; says Hotho in his history of German and Netherlandish painting,
&ldquo;with our knowledge, culture, and insight, on a summit from which we overlook
the whole past. The Orient, Greece and Rome, the Middle Ages, the
Reformation, and modern times, with their religion, literature, and art, their
deeds and their life, spread like a universal panorama before us; and it is one
that we must grasp with a universal feeling for the distinctiveness of every
people, of every epoch, and of every character. In this fashion to bury one&rsquo;s
self in the past, to get at the most essential meaning of its life by knowledge,
to awaken what is dead, and by art to renew what is vanished, and thus
to elevate the present to the level of the still living, kindred Mnemosyne of
the past, such is the vivifying work of our time; and to that work its best
powers must be devoted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The first who worked with these principles in Germany was <i>Lessing</i>. He
was a great landscape painter, and a clever and amiable man, whose house in
Karlsruhe was for many years a meeting-place for the polite world, and every
beginner, every young man of talent, visited
it to seek protection. During the winter of
1832-33 Menzel&rsquo;s <i>Geschichte der Deutschen</i> fell
into his hands. In it he read the story of
Huss and the Hussites, and with &ldquo;The Hussite
Sermon&rdquo; he soon afterwards began the
sequence of pictures which had as their theme
the battle between Church and State, the
struggle of the Popes with the Emperors, the
conflict between binding tradition and free
personal conviction&mdash;a sequence to be viewed
in connection with the opposition between
authority and freedom which had actually
arisen through Strauss&rsquo; <i>Life of Jesus</i>. &ldquo;Huss
before the Council,&rdquo; &ldquo;Huss on his Way
to the Stake,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Burning of the
Papal Ban,&rdquo; were found on their appearance exceedingly seasonable by the
orthodox, Protestant side. For people were determined to see in them, at
one time, the protests of a Protestant against the Catholic art tendencies of
the Nazarenes, at another, biting epigrams on the Catholic and pietistic bias,
ruling in Prussia under Friedrich Wilhelm <span class="sc">IV</span>. They are of historical interest
in so far as Lessing, before the period of French influence, anticipated in them
the path on which the German historical painting&mdash;whose centre through
Piloty came to be Munich&mdash;moved in the following years.</p>

<p><i>Piloty&rsquo;s</i> glory is to have planted the banner of colour on the citadel of
the idealistic cartoon drawers. True, it was only the discarded fleshings of
Delaroche; but since he possessed, side by side with a solid ability, pedagogic
capacities of the first rank, and thus brought to German art, in his own person,
all the qualities which it had wanted during half a century, his appearance
was none the less most important in its consequences. Even to-day, beside
Kaulbach&rsquo;s &ldquo;Jerusalem&rdquo; and Schnorr&rsquo;s &ldquo;Deluge&rdquo; in the new Pinakothek,
his &ldquo;Seni&rdquo; is indicative of the beginning of a new period. Before him the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page340" id="page340"></a>340</span>
celebrated men of the Munich school made a boast of not being able to paint,
and looked down upon the &ldquo;colourers&rdquo; with a contemptuous shrug; so here
everything was attained which the young generation had admired in Gallait
and Bièfve. This astounding revelation of colour was in 1855 praised in
Germany as something unheard of and absolutely perfect. There was no
more of the petty, motley, bodyless painting which had hitherto been dominant.
The manner in which the grey of morning falls upon the murdered man
in the eerie chamber, the way the clothes and the silken curtains glimmer,
were things which enchanted artists, whilst the lay public philosophised with
the thoughtful Seni over the greatness of heroes and the destiny of the world.
At one bound Piloty took rank as the first German &ldquo;painter&rdquo;; he was the
future, and he became the leader to whom young Munich looked up with
wonder. Before him no one had known how to paint a head, a hand, or a boot
in such a way. No one could do so much, and by virtue of this technical
strength he founded such a school as Munich had never yet seen. The consequence
of his advent was that the town could soon boast of many painters
who thoroughly understood their business. What an academical professor can
give his pupils (thorough groundwork in drawing and colour), that the young
generation received from Piloty, who at his death might have said with more
right than Cornelius: &ldquo;We have left a better art than we found.&rdquo; He who
discovered and guided so many men of talent, left behind him when he died a
well-drilled generation of painters; and far beyond the boundaries of Munich
they assure him the honourable title of a preceptor of Germany. The Munich
movement does not offer the example of passionate and embittered battles,
like those which the Parisian Romanticists maintained against the Classicists of
the school of David. The guard did not die, but surrendered, and retired
into an <i>otium cum dignitate</i>. Without a contest the ground was left to the
new generation, which was united by no bond of tradition with that which
had just been driven from the field; it was left to an unphilosophic, unpoetic
generation, whose only endeavour was to bind together the threads of
technical art which had been torn by unalterable circumstances.</p>

<p>This revolution was accomplished with almost unnatural swiftness. In
the lifetime of Cornelius himself the Franco-Belgian dogma of colour reached
its end and summit in Makart, with whom colour is an elementary power, overflowing
and levelling everything with the might of absolutism. In the same
year that Cornelius died &ldquo;The Pest in Florence&rdquo; made its tour through the
world. Already Schwind and Steinle, those two children of Vienna, had
separated themselves from the thoughtful stringency of form and plastic
clearness of their German comrades, by a certain coloured and lyrically
musical element in their work. And now also it was an Austrian who again
habituated the colour-blind eyes of the Germans to the splendour of pigment.
Michael Angelo&rsquo;s expression of form, as it had been imitated by Cornelius, was
opposed by the colour-symphonies of the Venetians: drapery and jewels,
brocade and velvet, and the voluptuous forms of women.</p>

<tr><td class="caption">HANS MAKART.</td></tr></table>

<p><i>Hans Makart</i> was a genius most
picturesque in his mode of life.
Whether this life was enacted in his
studio, fitted up like a ballroom, in
the Ring-Strasse, converted into a
stage, or upon his canvas, everything
was transformed for him into decoration
gleaming with colour. And
through this delight in colour the
most important impulses were given
in the most diverse provinces of life.
Against the dowdy lack of taste and
the harsh gaiety of ladies&rsquo; fashions
in that era he set his distinguished
costume pictures, carried out in
iridescent satin tones; and the enterprising
modistes translated them into
fact. The Makart hat, the Makart
roses, the Makart bouquet&mdash;very old-fashioned,
no doubt, at the present
time&mdash;were disseminated over the
world. Under the influence of Makart the whole province of the more artistic
trades was regarded from a pictorial point of view. Oriental carpets, heavy
silken stuffs, Japanese vases, weapons and inlaid furniture, became henceforth
the principal elements of decoration. The fashionable world surrounded
itself with brilliant colours; papers were supplemented by <i>portières</i> and
Gobelins, ceilings were painted, and gay umbrellas stood in the fireplace.
The bald, honest city-alderman style gave way, and a bright triumph of colour
took its place. In the studio of the master were the finest blossoms of all
epochs of art; richly ornamented German chests of the Renaissance stood
near Chinese idols and Greek terra-cotta, Smyrna carpets and Gobelins, and
old Italian and Netherlandish pictures were mingled with antique and mediæval
weapons. And amid this rich still-life of splendid vessels, weapons,
sculpture, and costly stuffs and costumes, which crowded all the walls and
corners, there rose to the surface as further pieces of decoration a velvet coat,
a pair of riding breeches, and a smart pair of Wallenstein boots. Their wearer
was a little man with a black beard, two piercing dark eyes, and one of
those splendid broad-browed heads which are universally accepted as the
sign of genius.</p>

<p>Makart&rsquo;s pictures are similar studies of still-life out of which human
figures rise to the surface. One hears the rustle of silk and satin, and the
crackle of costly robes of brocade; one sees velvet door-hangings droop in heavy
folds, but the figures which have their being in the midst are merely bodies and
not souls, flesh and no bones, colour and no drawing. Sometimes he draws
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page342" id="page342"></a>342</span>
better and sometimes worse, but never well. And therefore he seems unspeakably
small by the side of the old Venetians, who in such representation
combined a highly developed knowledge of form with luxuriant brilliancy of
colour. But even his colour, that flaunting, piquant, bituminous painting
derived from Delaroche, which once threw all Germany into ecstasies, no longer
awakes any cordial enthusiasm; and the fault is only partially due to the
rapid decay, the sadly dilapidated appearance of his pictures. There is not
much more remaining of them than of that shining festal procession which
for a forenoon set the streets of Vienna in uproar. Tone and colouring have
not become finer and more mellow with the years, as in old Gobelins, but
ever more spotty and dead. And even if they had remained fresh, would
they yet appeal to the present generation, so much more discriminating in
their appreciation of colour?</p>

<p>Makart, so much lauded as a painter of flesh, was never really able to
paint flesh at all. His feminine flesh tints are often bloodlessly white, and often
tinged by an unpleasant, sugary rose hue. The fresh fragrance of life is not
to be found in his figures, for they have been begotten, not by contact with
nature, but by commerce with old pictures. He was often reproached with
immorality by the prudish critics of earlier years; Heaven knows how stagnant
and stereotyped this nudity seems in the present day, and how tame this sensuousness,
even when one&rsquo;s thoughts do not happen to have been raised to
the great, carnal, and divine sensuousness of Rubens. Like Robert Hamerling,
allied to him by his intoxication in colour, Makart had a great momentary
success; but, like the former, the brilliancy of his work has swiftly paled,
and it is now seen how poor and sickly was the theme hidden behind the
lavish instrumentation. Because a correct and solid anatomy was wanting
to his creations from their birth upwards, they can live no longer now that
their blooming flesh is withered. In fact, Makart&rsquo;s painting was a weakly and
superficial art. He had a sense for nothing but what was external. It is said
that in Chile there are huge and splendid façades on which are written <i>Museo
Nacional</i>, <i>Theatro Nacional</i>, and there is nothing behind. And so for Makart
the world was a house with a splendid façade glowing with colour, but without
dwelling-rooms in which the sorrow and joy of humanity make their abode.
His men do not think and do not live; they are only lay figures for
splendid garments, or materially circumscribed spaces of rosy flesh colour;
they make a stuffed, brainless, animal effect. All his women heave up their
eyes in the same meaningless fashion, and have a vapid, doll-like trait about
their white teeth, laid bare as if for the dentist. It makes no difference
whether they are meant to be portraits or merely embody a feminine plastic
lyricism. It was not wise of Makart to paint a portrait. He might drape his
original after Palma Vecchio, after Rubens or Rembrandt, as Semiramis or
a Japanese; his intellectual incapacity remained always the same; the poetry
of the psychical nature evaporated from his art.</p>

<p>But all that cannot alter the fact that Makart takes a very high place
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page343" id="page343"></a>343</span>
amongst his contemporaries, in that epoch dominated by the historical painting,
and not yet arrived at an original conception of nature. Poussin said of
Raphael: if you compare him with the moderns he is an eagle, but if you
place him by the Greeks he is a sparrow. So when one thinks of Veronese or
Rubens, one finds on Makart the feathers of a sparrow, but amongst his contemporaries
in Germany he seems like an eagle. While all those from whom
he derived, those Pilotys, Gallaits, and Delaroches, were no more than skilled
historians in painting, Makart, though much tamer and smaller, has a relationship
with Delacroix in his sovereign artistry. That joy in the purely pictorial
which expressed itself in the festal procession in the Ring-Strasse and in the
furnishing of his studio was, moreover, the ground-principle of his art. With
the naïveté of the old masters he has boldly set himself above all historical
truth; with absolute want of respect for books of history he has committed
anachronisms at which any critic would be irritated. Revelling in splendid
revelations of colour, all that he concerned himself about was that his costumed
figures should render a fine harmony of hues. So exclusively was his eye
organised for colour that every picture was first conceived by him on the
palette as a luxuriant mass of colour, and he invented afterwards the theme
which was proper for it. If Delaroche transformed painting into the flat,
sober, and scientifically pedantic illustration of history, Makart gave it again
a bright and splendid play of colour. The Nazarenes were philosophers
and theosophers, the Romanticists revelled in lyrical sentiment. Kaulbach
was a philosophic historical student of the Hegelian school, Piloty a prosaic
and declamatory professor of history, Makart was the first German <i>painter</i>
of the century. His personages weary themselves out in the enjoyment of
their own dazzling outward personality. Free as the ancients with their gods
and legends, he pours forth his Cupids, beautiful women, genii, Bacchantes,
and historical figures, and at the same time draws into his kingdom of art all
nature with its variety of plants, flowers, and fruits, all civilisation with its
fulness of splendid vessels and jewels, of shining stuffs, emblems, weapons,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page344" id="page344"></a>344</span>
and masks. All that he created breathes the naïve, sensuous satisfaction of
the genuine painter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Pest in Florence&rdquo; undoubtedly had its origin in Boccaccio&rsquo;s description
of the great epidemic which visited the town on the Arno; but the picture
is a free fantasy of sensuous enjoyment and naked flesh, a colour symposium
in which there really lives an atom of the flaming vital energy of Rubens.</p>

<p>Take &ldquo;The Espousals of Catterina Cornaro,&rdquo; that gay procession of representatives
from Cyprus and Venice, of dignified men, of procurators of St.
Mark, of women in foreign garb, of bright colour, who crowd round their young
mistress, the queen of the feast, rejoicing amid the splendid architecture
of the piazza. To the anger of the historian, he removes the scene from the
fifteenth century to the blossoming period of the sixteenth, when the creations
of Sansovino, Titian, and Veronese adorned the Queen of the Adriatic. &ldquo;The
Entry of Charles <span class="sc">V</span> into Antwerp&rdquo; derived only its external impulse from
Dürer&rsquo;s Diary. The picture with the naked girls strewing flowers might
almost as well represent the triumphal entry of Alexander into Babylon. In
the magic land by the Nile it is not the history of civilisation and ethnography
that attracts him, nor the monumental world of the pyramids and the
temples of the gods, but the sensuous glow of southern nature and the still-life
and artistic accessories out of which the beautiful serpent Cleopatra is
seen to rise. Female bodies, animals, and fruits, set in the midst of rich,
luxuriant landscapes, painted with oil and bitumen, such are the elements of
which his pictures of the old world of legend&mdash;the hunt of the Amazons and
of Diana&mdash;are composed.</p>

<p>With these capacities Makart was scenical painter <i>par excellence</i>. His
Abundantia pictures in the Munich Pinakothek and the ceiling-pieces of the
Palais Tumba in Vienna are among his best creations. There lives in them
something of the Olympian blitheness of the ancients, of that easy joyousness
which since Tiepolo seemed to have been buried in melancholy reflection
and constrained brooding. They fulfil their purpose, as an invitation to the
enjoyment of life, precisely because they carry no intrinsic thought to burden
the sensuous display. Moreover, the unctuous and gorgeous colouring, with
the animated contrasts of warm brown and light blue, mediated by the deep,
glowing Makart red, corresponds to the mood they have been designed to
awaken&mdash;one which called forth the joy of life, luxuriant, full-blooded, and
foaming over. The great, fiery red flower, which sprouts out of the ground
at the feet of the nymph in &ldquo;Spring,&rdquo; was the last thing touched by Makart&rsquo;s
brush, the last flare of the marvellous colour-demon by which he was possessed.</p>

Was <i>possessed</i>! For Makart&rsquo;s whole artistic endeavour had something
unconscious. One might say in a variant reading from Lessing: &ldquo;If Makart
had been born without a brain he would nevertheless have been a great
painter.&rdquo; It is as if one who lies buried in Antwerp had once more felt the
instinct of production, and let himself down into the great head of the little
Salzburger; and the head, being a somewhat imperfect medium, only stammered
out the intentions of the sublime master. There is something remarkable
in the career of this son of the poor servant, on whom fortune showered
with full hands all it had to offer a child of the nineteenth century, and who
in the midst of his splendour in Vienna remained always the same harmless
child of nature that he had been in Munich, when, after receiving his first
hundred florins, he drove in a cab the two steps from Oberpollinger to the
Academy.</p>

<p>One must take him as he is&mdash;a product of nature. Makart was a scene
painter, and that not in his scenical pictures only; but he was an inspired
scene painter, of an enviable facility, who poured forth in play what others
fabricate with pains. His merit it is to have announced to the Germans afresh,
in an overwhelming style, that revelation of colour which had been forgotten
since the Venetians and Rubens. He has not advanced the history of art,
as such. What he gave had been given better before. But the history of
German art in the nineteenth century has to honour in him the most perfect
representative of the period in which colour-blindness was succeeded by
exuberance of colour, and the cartoon style by the delight in painting.</p>

<tr><td class="caption"><i>Graphische Kunst.</i></td></tr></table>

<p>Beside Makart, the child of nature, <i>Gabriel Max&rsquo;s</i> seems a calculating,
tormented, unhealthy talent. In the manner in which Makart did his work
there lay a certain elementary, logical necessity; in Max there is a great deal
of speculation and over-refinement. Makart&rsquo;s home was the town on the
lagoons. Max is by education and temperament a disciple of Piloty&mdash;that is
to say, a painter of disasters;
by birth he was a Bohemian.
And that resulted in his case
in a very interesting mixture.
When he exhibited his first
pictures it was as if one
heard a refined music after
the tom-tom of Piloty. In
his &ldquo;Martyr on the Cross,&rdquo;
which appeared in the spring
of 1867 in the Munich Kunstverein,
he first struck that
bitter-sweet, half-torturing,
half-ensnaring tone in which
he afterwards continued to
sound. It is dawn; a soft
grey light rests, beaming
mildly, over the lonely Campagna.
Here stands a cross
on which a girl-martyr has
ended her struggles. A young
Roman coming home from a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page348" id="page348"></a>348</span>
feast is so thrilled by the heavenly peace in the expression of the unhappy
girl&rsquo;s face that he lays a crown of roses at the foot of the cross, and
becomes a convert to the faith for which she has suffered. The mysterious
mortuary sentiment in the subject is strengthened by the almost ghostly
pallor of the colouring. Everything was harmonised in white, except that
one dark lock, falling across the pale forehead with great boldness, sounded
like a shrill dissonance in the soft harmony, like a wild scream; it had come
there apparently quite by chance, but was nevertheless calculated to a hair&rsquo;s
breadth. The terribly touching vision of the martyr aroused in every visitor
to the Kunstverein a shudder of delight. It was even a fine variation, and one
which invited pity, that the victim should not have been a hero, as in conventional
catastrophes, but a soft and sweet girl, made for love and never for
the cross. And it was the more absorbing, too, because it was impossible to
say whether the young Roman was looking up to the beautiful woman with
the desecrating sensuality of a <i>décadent</i> or with the fervid ecstasy of a convert.
The same horrified fascination was wakened again and again in the presence
of the later pictures of the painter. Almost every one contained a scene of
martyrdom, in which the tormented and sinking heroine was a helpless child
or a weak and defenceless woman. The passion for tragic subjects brought
into full swing by the historical painters was directed in Max against the
purest and tenderest, the most chaste and the most lovely. The type was
always the same, with its Bohemian nose and one eye larger than the other,
by which was attained a curiously visionary or hysterically enthusiastic
expression. And the pictorial treatment corresponded to it: there was
always a flesh-tint of poignant mortal pallor, a white clinging drapery, a
black veil, a light grey background, all harmonised in one very delicate chord.</p>

<p>Goethe&rsquo;s Gretchen made the beginning. In the Zwinger she lifted up her
eyes in frightened anguish to the countenance of the Madonna. She sat in
her cell, her face altered by madness and lit up with a wild laughter, and in a
reverie passed her hand through Faust&rsquo;s locks. Or as a phantom she wandered
in the Walpurgis night, in her long, flowing shroud, with a blood-red
stripe round her throat. This picture, exhibited with electric light, was
especially effective. Max had brought into the earnest corpse-like eyes an
expression that was terribly demoniacal, and had been attained to the same
degree by no earlier illustrator of <i>Faust</i>. A raven, pecking at the lost ring,
was her ghostly escort.</p>

<p>Max showed great invention in hitting upon such things. Bürger&rsquo;s <i>Pfarrertochter
von Taubenhain</i> gave him the material for his &ldquo;Child-murderess&rdquo;&mdash;a
young girl who, by the bank of a lonely pool, overgrown with reeds, stabs
her child to the heart with a needle, and in a sudden rush of maternal love
presses a kiss on the stiff little body before committing it to the water. Here
the sombre, disconsolate character of the landscape accorded finely with the
action, and the pale body of the child made an exceedingly bright, pungent
spot of colour on the dark-green rushes. &ldquo;The Lion&rsquo;s Bride&rdquo; illustrated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page349" id="page349"></a>349</span>
Chamisso&rsquo;s ballad of the jealous lion who killed his mistress before her wedding,
because he would not give her over to another. Majestically he lies behind
her, with one paw on the arm of the slain, and the other struck into her thigh.
The stones of the floor are reddened with her blood. But far more frequently
than blood Max employed the tints of corruption, the true <i>nature morte</i>. In
its colour-values and subtle shades the dead human body, just at the point
where corruption begins, was better suited to the painter&rsquo;s pallid scale of
colour than the light and brutally effective red of freshly poured-out blood.
Among these paintings of mortification must be reckoned &ldquo;Ahasuerus by the
Body of a Child&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Anatomist&rdquo;; the latter meditatively regards
at the dissecting-table the corpse, covered with white linen, of a young girl
who has committed suicide. In his &ldquo;Raising of Jairus&rsquo;s Daughter&rdquo; the
effect of mortification was most cleverly heightened by a small detail, which
made an extraordinary impression: this was a fly on the naked arm of the
girl, put there to remind the spectator of the unconsciousness of the body.</p>

<p>The secrets of death are always certain of their effect on the nerves; but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page350" id="page350"></a>350</span>
by means of the broken hearts of women, with annihilated hopes and agonised
hysterical sufferings, he succeeded again in calling forth a bitter-sweet sympathy.
&ldquo;Mary Magdalene&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Maid of Orleans&rdquo; were the masterpieces
of this group. The underlying idea of the picture &ldquo;Light&rdquo; is that a blind young
Christian girl, at the portal of the Roman catacombs, offers lamps to the
entering Christians for the illumination of their dark way. The blind woman
as the giver of light! Even in his youth, with cruel irony, he had had sung
by a blind quartet the song, &ldquo;<i>Du hast die schönsten Augen</i>.&rdquo; A touch of
Delaroche is in the other young martyr, who, between the bloodthirsty beasts
of the Roman circus, looks up amazed to the rows of spectators, from the midst
of which a young Roman has flung her a rose as a last greeting. In the next
moment she will be lying on the earth torn to shreds by the beasts.</p>

<p>As he succeeded here in giving a presentiment of the horrible, so in another
group of pictures Max attained a yet more demoniacal charm by the ghostly.
He had early made himself familiar with Schopenhauer and Buddha and the
Indian fakirs; the mystical and spiritualistic movement had just at that time
been set going by the writings of Carl Du Prels. Justinus Kerner and the
prophetess of Prevorst were the order of the day. Max became the painter of
hypnotism and spiritualism. &ldquo;The Spirit&rsquo;s Greeting&rdquo; made a special sensation:
the young girl at the piano, in this picture, is interrupted in her playing by
the touch of a materialised ghostly hand, which stretches towards her from
a soft cloudy mist. The mixture of horror, joy, devotion, and ecstasy in the
face of the young player was very effective. In order to render effects of the
kind he made extensive studies from the hypnotised model, and in this way
he sometimes reached an extraordinary intensity of expression. He took a
decided position with regard to another question which at the time was very
acute&mdash;vivisection. This he did in the picture of the man of science from
whom an allegorical female figure, &ldquo;The Genius of Pity,&rdquo; takes away a little
dog doomed to be dissected, showing by a pair of scales that the human heart
has more weight than the human understanding.</p>

<p>All this goes to show that Max is the opposite of artless. He knows how
to calculate an effect on the nerves with extreme subtlety, and most skilfully
at times to give his pictures the attraction of the freshly printed newspaper.
He appeals to compassion rather than imagination. He would set the heart
beating violently. He triumphs generally by his subjects, and his effects are
much purer in those few works in which he renounces the piquant adjunct of
the demoniacal, the tragical, and the mystical, and becomes merely a painter.
Amongst those works is to be reckoned that beautiful &ldquo;Madonna&rdquo; on the
altar, painted in 1886, and so tenderly illustrating the verses of Heine&mdash;</p>

<p class="noind">And so too does that charming &ldquo;Spring Tale&rdquo; of 1873, which breathes only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page351" id="page351"></a>351</span>
of gaiety, happiness, and peace; a young girl sits under the blossoming bushes,
and listens enraptured to the warbling of a nightingale.</p>

<p>Those pictures, the &ldquo;mood&rdquo; of which grows out of the landscape around&mdash;&ldquo;The
Nun in the Cloister Garden,&rdquo; &ldquo;Adagio,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Spring Tale,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Autumn Dance&rdquo;&mdash;give Max a very high and peculiar place in the work of
his period. He appears in them as a tender poet who expresses his emotions
through a pictorial medium; as an adorer of nature of a soft melancholy
and subtle delicacy, which are to be found in like manner only in the works
of the Englishmen Frederick Walker, George Mason, and George H. Boughton.
Nature sings a hymn to the soul of the painter, and through his figures it is
breathed forth in low, vibrating cadences. A tender landscape of earliest
spring gave the ground-tone to his charming picture &ldquo;Adagio.&rdquo; Young
trees with trembling stems raise their slender crowns into the pale blue sky
flecked with clouds. As yet the branches are almost naked; only here and
there appears the embroidery of fresh yellowish green. And in this soft,
tender nature which shyly reveals itself as with a slight shudder after its long
winter sleep, there are seated two beings: a boy and his young mother&mdash;she
looks almost a child&mdash;dreamily meditating. Their eyes look strangely into
vacancy, as though their thoughts are wandering. Nature works on them,
and a melancholy <i>Warte nur balde</i> runs through their souls. A spring
landscape of blissful gaiety, where nightingales warble, butterflies sip at the
flowers, and sunbeams play coquettishly round the budding rosebushes, is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page352" id="page352"></a>352</span>
the Setting of the &ldquo;Spring Tale.&rdquo; Everything laughs and rejoices, shines and
scents the air in the early sunlight. Pearls of dew sparkle on the meadows,
gnats hum and leaves murmur. She thinks of him. All the joy of a first
love-dream sets her heart quivering with a delicious tremor. In her heart
as in nature it is spring. Yet even as a landscape painter Max generally has
that tender, suffering trait which runs through his creative work elsewhere.
Twilight, autumn, pale sky and dead leaves have made the deepest impression
on his spirit. Thin, half-stunted trees, in the leaves of which the evening
wind is playing, grow upon an undulating, poverty-stricken soil. The landscape
spreads around with a kind of lyrical melancholy: a region which gives
no exuberant assurance of being beautiful, but which, in its poverty, attunes
the mind to melancholy; a region, however, which knows not of storms and
loneliness, but is the peaceful dwelling of quiet and resigned men. These
beings belong to no age; their costume is not modern, but neither is it taken
from any earlier period. They do not act and they tell no story; they dream
their time away meditatively and gravely. Max has divested them of everything
fleshly and vulgar, so that only a shadow of them remains, a soul that
vibrates in exquisite, dying, elusive chords. &ldquo;The Autumn Dance&rdquo; is such
an unearthly picture, and one of indefinable magic. Children and women are
dancing, yet one feels them to be religious dreamers whom a melancholy
world-weariness and a yearning after the mystical have drawn together to
this secret and sequestered corner of the earth. The pale, transparent air, the
tender tints of the dresses, delicate as fading flowers, the flesh tint giving the
figures something ghostly and ethereal&mdash;it all strikes a note at once blythe
and sentimental, happy and sad. &ldquo;The Nun in the Cloister Garden&rdquo; is in
point of landscape one of his finest productions. In the cloister garden,
despite the budding spring, there reigns a disconsolate dreariness. On the
thin grass sits a young nun, who follows dreamily the gay fluttering of two
butterflies, which flit around at her feet. A black dress, harshly and abruptly
crossed by a white cape, envelops the youthfully delicate form. The dying
sapling on which she is leaning bends helplessly against the stubborn paling to
which it is fastened with iron clamps. The weather-stained wall stretches
along in a dreary monotonous grey. An old sundial relentlessly indicates the
slow dragging hours. But the deep blue heaven, in which a pair of larks
poise exulting, looks in across the wall, from which a scrubby growth climbs
shivering in the breeze.</p>

<p>In such pictures, too, Max has a morbid inclination to a mystical delicacy
of sentiment. He gives what is real an exquisite subtlety which transplants
it into the world of dreams, and his tender sense of pain perhaps appeals only
to spirits of an æsthetic temper. He is the antithesis of robust health; and
yet there lies in the excess of nervous sensibility&mdash;in the pathological trait in
his art&mdash;precisely the quality which inspires the characteristic delicacy of his
earlier works. Here is no pupil of Piloty, but our contemporary. In their
anæmic colour his pictures have the effect of a song of high, fine-drawn, and
tremulous violin tones, at once
dulcet and painful. With
their refinement and polish,
their subtle taste and intimate
emotion, so wonderfully
mingled, they reach the music
of painting. They paint the
invisible, they revel in dreams.
In a period which played only
<i>fortissimo</i>, and was at pains to
drum on all the senses at once
with a distorting passion, Max
was, next to Feuerbach, the
first who prescribed for his
compositions <i>dolce</i>, <i>adagio</i>, and
<i>mezza voce</i>; who sought for
the refined, subdued emotions
in place of the <i>emotions fortes</i>.</p>

<p>These pictures, the more
subdued the better, make him
the forerunner of the most
modern artists, and assure his
name immortality much more
certainly than the great figure
resting on an historical
or literary basis. Their delicate black, green, and white simplicity has
a nobleness of colouring which stands quite alone in the German painting
of the century, and this, together with their refined musical sentiment, is
probably to be set rather to the account of his Bohemian blood than of his
Munich training. And whilst in the heads of his figures elsewhere a certain
monotonous vacuity disturbs one&rsquo;s pleasure, he appears here as a psychic
painter of the highest mark; one who analysed with the most subtle
delicacy all the fleeting <i>nuances</i>&mdash;so hard to catch&mdash;of melancholy, silent
resignation, yearning, and hopelessness. Only the figures of the English
new pre-Raphaelites have the same sad-looking, dove-like eyes, the same
spiritual lips, tremulous as though from weeping. There must have been
a divine moment in his existence when he first filled the loveliest form
with the expression of the holiest suffering, the sweetest reverie, the deepest
devotion, and the most rapt ecstasy. And if later, when people could not
weary of this expression, he took to producing it without real feeling and by
purely stereotyped means, that is, at any rate, a weakness of temperament
which he shares with others.</p>

<p>Gabriel Max is an individuality, not of the first rank indeed, but he is one;
and there are not many painters of the nineteenth century of whom that can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page356" id="page356"></a>356</span>
be said. He has often underlined
too heavily, printed
too much in italics, and
done more homage to crude
than to fine taste. But he
has, in advance of his contemporaries,
in whose works
the good was so seldom new,
the priceless virtue that he
always gave something new,
if not something good. His
art was without ancestry, an
entirely personal art; something
which no one had
before Max, and which after
him few will produce again.
A province which had not
yet been trodden, the province
of the enigmatic and
ghostly, was opened up by
him; he set foot in it because
he is a philosophic brooder,
fascinated by the magic of
the uncanny. His studio is
like a chapel in which a
mysterious service for the
dead is being held, or the chamber of an anatomist, rather than the
workroom of a painter. The investigation of dead birds occupied him after
his Prague days just as much as the sounding of the life of the human
spirit. He lived at the time with his parents in an old, ghostly house, and
roamed about a great deal in the picture gallery of the Strahow foundation;
and here in lonely nights and mysterious picture-rooms there arose that grave
and sombre spirit which runs through his work. As a child at the death of
his father he had his first &ldquo;vision.&rdquo; His earliest picture, which he finished
while at the Prague Academy, and sold afterwards to the Art Union there for
ninety florins, showed that he had begun to move on his later course: &ldquo;Richard
the Lion-heart steps to the Corpse of his Father and it bleeds.&rdquo; He was thus
inwardly ripe when, in 1863, he came to Piloty in Munich, and, equipped
with the technique of the latter, refined in so delicate a manner on the traditional
painting of disasters. And if a conscious design on the nerves of the multitude
frequently entered into his work, it was, as a rule, veiled by captivating beauty
and excellence of painting. His older good pictures fascinate the most jaded
eye by their remarkably tender sentiment, and the mystical spirituality of
his soft and lovely girlish heads has been reached by few in his century. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page357" id="page357"></a>357</span>
is at the same time a colourist of complete individuality, who made pigments
the subtilised and ductile means of expression for his visionary moods of soul.
He has brought into the world a numerous stock of works prepared for the
market; and he has not disdained to paint glorified wonders of the fair, like
the Christ&rsquo;s head upon the handkerchief of Veronica, whose eyes seem to be
closed by their lids and are looking out at the same time wide open. But
much as he sinned, he always remained an artist. A curious, interesting,
characteristic mind, one of the few who ventured even forty years ago to give
themselves out as children of their time, in the firmament of German, and
indeed of European art, he appears as a star shining by its own and not by
borrowed light, as one whose incommensurable magnitude it is that his talent
cannot be compared with any other. That is what gives him his artistic
importance.</p>

<p>All the less room can be claimed by the many who, likewise following in
their subject-matter the lines of Piloty, get no further than the traditional
catastrophe. Not Munich only, but all Germany, lay for more than a decade
after the middle of the century under the shadow of historical painting, which
here, as in other countries, came as the logical product of an unhappy time,
dissatisfied with its own existence when Germany was merely a geographical
expression, and in the pitiable misery of that age of state-confederations,
dreamt of a better future
at singing contests, athletic
tournaments, and rifle meetings.
The more poverty-stricken
the time was in real
action, the more vehement
was the desire to read of
action in books or to see it
on canvas; and in this respect
historical painting rendered at
that time important political
services, which are to be acknowledged
with gratitude;
just as the historical drama,
the historical ballad and the
historical novel were, all and
several, means for the expression
of the deep-seated longing
of a backward people for
political labours, for deeds
and for fame.</p>

<p>But the artistic yield was
not greater than elsewhere.</p>

<p>When the learned in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page358" id="page358"></a>358</span>
thirties laid it down in doctrinaire fashion that, with the destruction of
religious fervour begun by science, the old traditionary sacred painting
would fall away of itself and the painting of profane history take its place,
they overlooked from the very beginning the fact that, so long as the much
discussed worship of genius had not actually become a reality the painting
of history had to fight against insuperable obstacles. What constitutes the
prime condition of all art&mdash;that its contents must be some fact vivid in
consciousness&mdash;should, at any rate, determine its limitations, and ought to
have confined the historical picture to the nearest universally known subjects.
And what happened was just the contrary.</p>

<p>When Delaroche had skimmed the cream, his successors were forced to
search in the great martyr book of history for events which were more and
more unknown and indifferent. Piloty took from ancient history &ldquo;The Death
of Alexander the Great,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Death of Cæsar,&rdquo; &ldquo;Nero at the Burning of
Rome,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Triumphal Progress of Germanicus&rdquo;; and from mediæval
history, &ldquo;Galileo in his Prison observing the Periodic Return of a Solar Ray,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Columbus sighting Land&rdquo;; from the history of the Thirty Years&rsquo; War,
&ldquo;The Foundation of the Catholic League by Duke Maximilian of Bavaria,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Seni before the Body of Wallenstein&rdquo; (the morning before the battle at the
White Mountain, Seni has come to carry away Wallenstein&rsquo;s body), &ldquo;Wallenstein
on the way to Eger,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The News of the Battle at the White
Mountain&rdquo;; from English history, &ldquo;The Death Sentence of Mary Stuart&rdquo;;
and from French history, &ldquo;The Girondists on their Way to the Scaffold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After these pictures were painted and had had their success the turn came,
in the years immediately following, for subjects growing steadily more and
more dreary. And as Goethe held the historical to be &ldquo;the most ungrateful
and dangerous field,&rdquo; so it now appeared as though laurels were to be gathered
there only. From the political dismemberment of the present, German artists
were glad to seek refuge as far back as possible in the past, and they flung
themselves on the new province with such fiery zeal that, after a few decades,
there was a really appalling number of historical pictures, illustrating every
page of Schlosser&rsquo;s great history of the world. <i>Max Adamo</i> painted &ldquo;The
Netherlandish Nobles before the Tribunal of Alva,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Fall of Robespierre

<p>Was it at all possible to make works of art out of such material? Perhaps
it was. The real artist can do anything. What he touches becomes gold,
for he has the hand of Midas. But just as certain it is that the &ldquo;historical
painting,&rdquo; carried on by a joint-stock company, almost never got any further
than stage pathos, tailoring, and glittering splendour of material. Like many
another thing which the nineteenth century brought to birth, it was an artistic
error, which countless persons paid for by the waste of their lives. The older
art knew nothing of such a reconstruction of the past. If historical subjects
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page360" id="page360"></a>360</span>
were painted, the artists were almost throughout contemporaries of the subject
that was to be treated; seldom did the materials belong to an epoch already
past. But in both cases the work was done by immediate intuition, since even
in the treatment of matters long gone by the painters never dreamed of painting
them in the spirit of past times. They might depict Jews, or Greeks, or Romans,
but they always represented their own countrymen in the surroundings and
costume of their own time. The scientific nineteenth century made the first
demand for historical accuracy. In dress and furniture this could be attained
with the assistance of a cabinet of engravings and a work on costume. Whoever
went to work in a very scientific spirit could even borrow from a museum
the genuine costumes of Egmont and Wallenstein. But it was all the harder
artistically to quicken into life the men themselves who had felt, lived, and
suffered in the past. The painter could not proceed otherwise than by draping
a modern, professional model, having consulted portraits, drawings, or busts,
and having sought the aid of a peruke and false beard. An entirely realistic
reproduction of this masquerade, however, made only too evident the contrast
between the splendid old garment and the member of the proletariat who
was dressed up in it. For, granted that men of the present have much in
common with those of the past, every period has none the less its own type,
even its own gestures, which no costume can make one forget. And speaking
merely of general humanity, there is no question that a statesman at all times
looked different from a professional model. In a very bad suit of clothes, but
in one which, at any rate, fitted him, and in which he was able to behave
himself naturally, the poor fellow came to the studio, to feel, for a few hours,
in satin hose and a velvet doublet, like a carnival figure. Who was to give
him the easy knightly bearing to play his part suitably to the occasion? It
was not possible in this way ever to attain the naturalness and fulness of life
of the old painters. In Terborg&rsquo;s &ldquo;Peace of Westphalia&rdquo; everything is
genuine and true and simple; here wig and woollen beard have got the upper
hand. And if the painter proceeded not as a theatrical tailor, but as an
historian of civilisation, the result was an archaic dryness. For then he was
merely thrown back on the great masters of those periods in which the action
took place, and, while he enlarged and coloured old busts or engraved portraits,
his art was only second-hand.</p>

<p>And so the only way out of the difficulty was to use the model, but to
idealise him by generalising and sinking the individual in the universally
human, noble, and heroic. In this way the remarkable family likeness of all
these heads becomes comprehensible, and it is still further heightened by that
preference for a monotonous type of beauty which, from the period of Classicism,
entered, as it were, into the blood of these painters. The human physiognomy,
in reality so various, had then only one mask for the many characters which
life creates. There was a fear of &ldquo;ugliness,&rdquo; as if it were a spot of dirt, and
the personages portrayed received, one and all, an icy trait of &ldquo;the Beautiful.&rdquo;
The various Egmonts, Wallensteins, and Charles the Firsts of Gallait and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page361" id="page361"></a>361</span>
Bièfve, Delaroche, and Piloty have not the blood of human beings, they have
not the scars which are made by fate, but are all alike in their Byronic turn
of the head. One knows the so-called character-heads&mdash;Luther gazing upwards
with the look of one strong in faith, Columbus discovering America, and Milton
in whose head are seething all the thoughts which dying men are wont to have
in their last moments,&mdash;one knows them as thoroughly by heart as one knows
all the opened folios and overturned settles, the picturesquely draped tapestry
reserved for tragic funereal service, and that little box, covered with brass
and catching the flashing lights, which constitutes in Belgium, France, and
Germany the iron casket of all historical pieces. In the place of the inward
Shakespearian truth of the figures, peculiar to the old masters, is the outward
truth of costume; and the historical &ldquo;property man,&rdquo; whose highest aim is
to &ldquo;dress&rdquo; the great moments of universal history in the prescribed manner,
has stepped into the place of the artist. In the works of the old masters the
historical figures stand out with sincerity as characters of flesh and blood,
despite the want of &ldquo;local colour,&rdquo; whilst in the moderns the costumes certainly
are correct, but the figures are so much the less credible and vital. &ldquo;Beautiful
may be the folds of the garment, but more beautiful must be that which they
contain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Clothes do not make people, and costumes heighten no passions. Thus
difficulties were heaped on difficulties, when impassioned situations and
moments of dramatic intensity were to be painted. Whoever has reached
that height of artistic power where the artist may with impunity put his model
out of his head&mdash;like Delacroix, grand, volcanic, stormy, and excited to a fever
heat by his inspiration,&mdash;that man will be capable of giving the effect of truth
to such scenes, and of running through the whole gamut of emotion with a
crushing power of conviction. But the joint-stock historical painter had to
get his models to pull faces, and then no less laboriously to render with his
oils those grimaces so laboriously produced. Hence the monotonous and
petrified histrionic ecstasy of these pictures, the noble indignation put on for
show, and that distressing gesticulation. As the actor gives emphasis to his
words far more by gestures than is the case in ordinary life, so here also the
artificially impassioned air of the heads was conventionally interpreted by
corresponding motions of the arms. And thus the closing tableau was made
ready: the dancers lay their hands on their hearts with tender and deep feeling;
the tenor heroes sing that they are prepared to die; the tyrants let their deep
basses vibrate, and the orchestra rages, to close with a shattering chord at the
moment when the hero sets his foot upon the chest of the traitor; then come
the Bengal lights, and then the curtain falls. What a spectacle!&mdash;but, alas,
a spectacle and nothing more. All the emotions are artificial; they are opera
emotions: the painters are only clever fellows, manufacturers of librettos
and gay canvas; they show a great deal of knowledge and dexterity, but
they have only a head and no heart. Stage requisites and professional models
can never take the place of the free, creative force of imagination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page362" id="page362"></a>362</span></p>

<p>And if German pictures of this sort have an effect almost more insincere
and theatrical than the French, the reason probably is that gesture&mdash;that
external aid to the expression of feeling&mdash;is always more natural to the Latin
than the Teutonic races, and has therefore, of itself, an effect of affectation
in every German picture. We know that Bismarck, the Teuton incarnate,
even in the most excited of parliamentary speeches, never made any other
movement than to rap nervously with his pencil. &ldquo;The German only becomes
impassioned when he lies.&rdquo; The most genuine masters of German blood have
felt that right well, and they have been honest enough to say it out. A pervading
trait of old German art is simplicity, the avoidance of everything
impassioned even in the grandest conception, such as Dürer has. If in Leonardo&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Last Supper&rdquo; terror, indignation, curiosity, and sorrow are reflected
by twelve heads and twenty-four hands in movements of agitation which
are always new, in Dürer&rsquo;s woodcut all the limbs and senses of the disciples
are paralysed at the sorrowful revelation of the Saviour; it seemed to them
desecration to break the solemn, oppressive stillness by noisy utterances of
opinion and hasty gestures. And the same thing is to be remarked in every
similar picture of Rembrandt&rsquo;s; here too are only quiet and subdued movements,
delicate suggestions and silence. The effect is great and sublime, the
features of the Saviour earnest and expressive, but His mien is without any
ecstatic emphasis such as a painter of Romance blood would have given Him.
Only in the nineteenth century&mdash;partly through imitation of the Italians in
Cornelius and Kaulbach, and then through imitation of the French in Piloty
and his disciples&mdash;has this impassionedness, so opposed to German nature,
entered into German art; and it has borrowed from the opera the distortions
by which it has expressed the agitations of the spirit. No one works with
impunity against the grain of his temperament. Exaggerated and violent
movements, &ldquo;ostentatious gestures of false dignity,&rdquo; have replaced the natural
expressions of life.</p>

<p>Less pose, parade, and theatricality, more ease, truth, and quietude; less
insipid, generalised &ldquo;beauty,&rdquo; more forcible, characteristic &ldquo;ugliness&rdquo;: if
art was not to be drowned in a surge of phrases, this was the path to be taken;
and the transition was accomplished in &ldquo;the historical picture of manners.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="center chap2">THE VICTORY OVER PSEUDO-IDEALISM</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">Immediately</span> upon the epoch-making labours of the historians followed
the first romances that were archæological and dealt with the history
of civilisation; and hand in hand with these literary productions there was
developed&mdash;by the side of historical painting proper, in France, Belgium,
and Germany&mdash;a tendency to represent the life of the past, not in its grand
dramatic action, but in its familiar concerns. In the one case there was
history in its state uniform, in the other history in undress. And while
the former class of painters saw the past only in a condition of unrest and
violent movement, the latter began to enter into the details of daily life, and
to represent it as it flowed by in times of peace. Those who had the romantic
bias turned to the old artistic crafts. As yet that bias consisted only in an
enthusiasm for the tasteful civilisation of a bygone age, with its polished
charm of luxurious household appointments and pleasing costume. Rooms
were filled with Gobelins and rich stuffs, handsome furniture and old pictures.
By the rapid sale of their productions painters were placed in a position to
acquire for themselves at the second-hand dealers all the beautiful things
they painted. They placed their dressed-up models in front of their tapestries,
and between their cabinets and tables. Stress was laid on historical accuracy in
the representation of the usages and costumes of the past, not on dramatic
action, and in this respect the historical picture of manners, as opposed to
historical painting, marked an advance towards intimacy of feeling. The
latter still worked from the abstract. The painter read a book and looked
out for telling passages. He idealised models, to lend his picture the character
of &ldquo;great art.&rdquo; It was always the illustration of underlying ideas.</p>

<p>In this new kind of picture, on the contrary, the conception of a work
of art was given, by the perfected representation of any part of the visible
world, were it only the corner of a studio elaborately and artificially arranged.
The historical picture of manners no longer depicted &ldquo;the meeting of hostile
forces,&rdquo; but either the heroes of history or the nameless men of the past in
their daily act and deed, and so accustomed the public gradually to interest
themselves in people who did not act with histrionic passion, but conducted
themselves quietly and soberly like men of the present time. The place of
the dramatic was taken by those phases of life which are pleasant and smooth.
At the same time there was no need to be thrown back on conventional
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page364" id="page364"></a>364</span>
idealisation, and it was possible to bring people dressed up for the occasion
directly into the picture, just as they sat there, since the contrast between
the professional model and the old-fashioned dress made itself less felt on
this smaller scale of art. Thus was achieved the transition from the heroic
historical art of the first half of the nineteenth century to that familiar and
more human art of the second half, which no longer fled for help to the past,
but sought a simpler ideal in reality.</p>

<p>First of all in France, from the side of the solemnly earnest group of
Academicians, there stepped forward certain artists who moved in the old
world quite at their ease, and began to paint simple little pictures from the
daily life of antiquity, instead of the great ostentatious canvases of David
and Ingres. In literature their parallels are Ponsard and Augier, who in their
comedies brought antique life upon the stage, the one in <i>Horace et Lydie</i>,
the other in <i>La Ciguë</i> and <i>Le Joueur de Flûte</i>.</p>

<p><i>Charles Gleyre</i> approached nearest to the strict academical style of Ingres.
Not even by a tour in the East did he allow himself to be led away from the
Classical manner, and as head of a great and leading studio he recognised it
as the task of his life to hand on to the present generation the traditions of
the school of Ingres. Gleyre was a man of sound culture, who during a
sojourn in Italy which lasted for years, had examined Etruscan vases and
Greek statues with unintermittent zeal, studied the Italian classics, and copied
all Raphael. Having come back to Paris, he never drew a line without having
first assured himself how Raphael would have proceeded in the given case.
And this striving after purity of form has robbed his works (&ldquo;Nymph Echo,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Hercules at the Feet of Omphale,&rdquo; and the like) almost entirely of ease,
freshness, and naturalness. Gleyre became, like Ary Scheffer, a victim to
style. He had in him&mdash;his &ldquo;Evening&rdquo; of 1843 is sufficient to show it&mdash;a
tender, dreamy, and contemplative spirit. The feelings to which he wished
to give expression were his own, and the more fragrant, romantic, and
vaporously indistinct they were, the more did they suffer from the stiff
academical line in which he so mercilessly bound them. Only in his &ldquo;Orpheus
torn by the Bacchantes&rdquo; has he raised himself to a certain neo-Greek elegance.</p>

<p><i>Louis Hamon</i> stands at the end of this path, which led gradually from
the strictness of form characteristic of the idealism of Ingres to incidents
thought out in perfectly modern fashion and laid in a primitive era only
because of the advantages of costume offered by the antique. The grace of
his pictures is modern; their Classicism is a disguise. To robust natures his
art can make but little appeal. He has deprived nature of her strength
and marrow, and painting of its peculiar qualities, transforming them into a
coloured dream, a tinted mist. In Hamon&rsquo;s modelling there is an uncertainty,
in his colour a sickly weakness and meagre effeminacy, which give to his figures
and landscapes the appearance of being dissolved in vapour. Everything
firm is taken from them; the stones look like wadding, the plants like soap,
the figures like china dolls which would fly into the air at the least gust of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page365" id="page365"></a>365</span>
wind. Nevertheless there are times when his confectionery has a sympathetic
grace. What distinguishes him is something simple, pure, youthful,
fresh, and childlike. His colour is lighter and more delicate than Gleyre&rsquo;s.
None but blended colours such as light blue and light yellow mingle in the
harmony of white tones. The severe antique style has been given a pretty
<i>rococo</i> turn: his Greek girls, women, and children are like figures of Sèvres
porcelain; the scenes in which he groups them are pleasing,&mdash;sports of fancy
brought forward in a Grecian garb, of an affected sensuousness and a coquettish
grace. His prettiest picture was probably &ldquo;My Sister&rsquo;s not at Home&rdquo;&mdash;Greece
seen through a gauze transparency in the theatre.</p>

<p><i>Léon Gérôme</i> has also a taste for borrowing his subjects from the antique;
being a pupil of Delaroche, however, he has treated not mythological but
historical episodes of antiquity. His &ldquo;Cock-fight,&rdquo; &ldquo;Phryne before the
Areopagus,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Augurs,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Gladiators,&rdquo; &ldquo;Alcibiades at the House of
Aspasia,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Death of Cæsar,&rdquo; together with pictures from Egypt,
are his most characteristic works: Ingres and Delaroche upon a smaller scale.
He shares with the one his learnedly pedantic composition, and with the other
his taste for anecdote. It may be remarked that in these same years Emile
Augier was active in literature, but that Augier, living in the same epoch of
modern life, is far more powerful and animated in his Classical pieces.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page366" id="page366"></a>366</span>
Gérôme&rsquo;s art is an intelligent, frigid, calculating art. In execution he does
not rise above a petty study of form and an academic discipline. His drawing
is accurate, and he has even succeeded in giving his figures a certain natural
truth which is in advance of the generalisation of the classic ideal; yet from
first to last he is wanting in every quality as a painter. His pictures of the
East are hard landscapes, in which men or animals, harder still&mdash;unfortunate,
eternally petrified beings&mdash;stand out abruptly. He draws and stipples, he
works like an engraver in line, and goes over what he has painted again and
again with a fine and feeble brush. He has an eye for form, but the effect
of light upon the body escapes him. His pictures therefore give the impression
of china, and his colour is hard and dead. What distinguishes him is a watchful
observation, a chilling correctness, enclosing everything in characterless
outlines. And this marble coldness remained with him later when, moving
with the development of historical painting, he gradually took to working
on more tragical subjects. Even the most violent subjects are depicted with
a dainty grace, and with a smile he serves up decapitated heads, prepared
with a painting <i>à la maitre d&rsquo;hôtel</i>, upon a gold-rimmed porcelain plate as
smooth as glass.</p>

<p>Another painter of archæological <i>genre</i> is <i>Gustave Boulanger</i>, who after
extensive studies in Pompeii gave a vogue to those antique interiors and
scenes of Pompeian street life now associated with the name of Alma-Tadema.</p>

<p>Direct descendants of Delaroche and Robert Fleury were those who threw
themselves enthusiastically into treating the physiognomy of the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries, and devoted the most ardent study to the weapons,
costumes, and furniture of those epochs. They never wearied in representing
François <span class="sc">I</span> and Henri <span class="sc">IV</span> in the most varied situations of life, nor in searching
the biographies of great artists and scholars for episodes worth painting.
Especially popular subjects were those of celebrated painters at their meeting
with contemporaries of high station: Raphael and Michael Angelo coming across
each other in the Vatican, Murillo as a boy, the young Ribera found drawing
in the street by a Cardinal, Bellini in his studio amid all manner of precious
objects, Charles <span class="sc">V</span> and Titian, Michael Angelo tending his servant, and others
of the same kind. The number of painters who were active in this province
is as great as the number of anecdotes which are told of distinguished men.
They spread themselves over various countries, like the swarms of insects
hatched on a summer&rsquo;s day amid luxuriant vegetation, and thereby they
render the task of selection more difficult to the historian. In France there
worked <i>Alexander Hesse</i>, <i>Camille Roqueplan</i>, and <i>Charles Comte</i>; in Belgium,
<i>Alexander Markelbach</i> and <i>Florent Willems</i>. Markelbach, a pupil of Wappers,
in addition to episodes from English history, specially devoted himself to
painting the shooting festivals of the old Netherlandish city guards, in which
enterprise the Doelen pieces of Frans Hals did him excellent service in the
matter of costume. Florent Willems, who, as a restorer, saturated himself
with the manner of the old masters, was particularly popular on account of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page367" id="page367"></a>367</span>
the smooth finish he gave to his modish ladies, cavaliers, soldiers, painters,
soubrettes, and patrician matrons of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.
All the richly coloured satin, brocade, and velvet costumes of these personages,
together with the tapestry, the curtains, and the furniture of their dwellings,
he had the secret of reproducing in such a fashion that he was long esteemed
a modern Terborg. Amongst the Germans, <i>L. von Hagn</i> was the most delicate
of these artists, and the graceful comedies of real life which he painted, transplanting
them into the Italian Renaissance or the French <i>rococo</i> period,
have often great distinction of colouring. <i>Gustav Spangenberg</i>, after the lucky
but isolated success he had made with &ldquo;The Track of Death,&rdquo; devoted himself
to the Reformation period; and <i>Carl Becker</i> to the Venetian Renaissance,
from which he occasionally made an excursion into the German. These and
many others could be discussed with more particularity if their pictures,
smooth as coloured prints, and neatly finished in their own paltry way, were
not so much below the standard of galleries. For them also the incident
to be represented, with the personages concerned in it, was the principal matter,
and not pure painting. These fetters upon true art were first shaken off
by the hands of the following painters.</p>

<p>Of the generation of the eminent Flemish artists of 1830 <i>Hendrik Leys</i> is
the one whose fame has been most enduring. Born in Antwerp on 18th February
1815, at first destined for the priesthood, and then in 1829 admitted to the
studio of Ferdinand de Braekeleers, he had made his début in the beginning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page368" id="page368"></a>368</span>
of the thirties with a pair of historical pictures. These indeed revealed
little of the power which he evinced later, but they furnished some indication
of what he was aiming at. Here were none of the skirmishes&mdash;so
popular at the time&mdash;in which blood flows as from the pipes of a fountain;
the combatants fought with decorum and moderation, and less from conviction
than to justify the helmets and cuirasses which had been fetched
from the wardrobe. In both of them, on the other hand, the background&mdash;a
mediæval town with tortuous alleys, lanterns, and picturesque taverns&mdash;was
most lovingly treated. Here was revealed a thoroughly German
delight in minute detail. Instead of subordinating the accessories as others
did, with the object of throwing the principal personages into relief, Leys
represented an entire corner of the world at once, giving full distinctness
to the smallest things, down to the implements of daily life, the grasses
and flowers of the landscape, and the variegated corner-stones of the old
house-fronts, whose picturesque porches and lattices bulge into the crooked
lanes. His next picture, &ldquo;The Massacre of the Löwen Magistrates,&rdquo; was
a still further departure from precedent, since&mdash;quite in Callot&rsquo;s manner&mdash;it
mingled with the principal drama a mass of grotesque episodes. The born
<i>genre</i> painter was announced by these traits; and not less striking was the
form of the art, which was a thorough departure from the manner of the
&ldquo;painters of the grand style.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The resuscitation of a national art, which had been the life-long aim of
Gustav Wappers, who was twelve years his senior, was what Leys also set
up as the goal of his artistic endeavours. But their ways divided. Wappers
was principally inspired by Rubens, while Leys attached himself at first to
the Dutch painters. A visit made to Amsterdam in 1839 had helped him to
an understanding of Rembrandt and Pieter de Hoogh. He followed them
when, in 1845, he painted his &ldquo;Wedding in the Seventeenth Century&rdquo;&mdash;a
rich display of gleaming hangings, golden plate, and red-plush furniture,
amid which move handsomely dressed people, wedding guests, and violin
players. The effort to approach Pieter de Hoogh or Jan van der Meer is
apparent in the management of light; the treatment of drapery reminds one
of Mieris and Metsu. Another pair of anecdotic pictures from the seventeenth
century allow one to follow the progress by which Leys, under the influence
of Dutch models, gradually developed that power and mastery of colouring,
that completeness of pictorial effect, and that soft treatment of subdued
light which were justly admired in his first works. In particular, certain
works founded on the legends of painters and monarchs&mdash;Rubens, Rembrandt,
or Frans Floris visited in their studio by some personage of high station&mdash;made
him the lion of the Paris Salon. In 1852 he stood at the summit of
his fame; he was recognised as one of the first of painters, both in Belgium
and in other countries, and was everywhere loaded with honours. Then
he cast his slough and entered on his &ldquo;second manner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After he had followed Rembrandt for more than a decade he turned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page369" id="page369"></a>369</span>
from him to cast himself suddenly into
the arms of the German masters of the
sixteenth century, and, according to his
own saying, &ldquo;from that time forward to
become an artist.&rdquo; During a tour through
Germany, in 1852, he had become familiar
with Dürer and Cranach; in Dresden,
Wittenberg, and Eisenach there hovered
round him the great figures of the Reformation
period. Half-effaced memories of
his countrymen, the brothers Van Eyck and
Quentin Matsys, became once more fresh,
and drove him decisively forward on his new
course. &ldquo;The Festival at Otto Venius&rsquo;s&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Erasmus in his Study&rdquo; were the first
steps in this direction, and when soon afterwards
he came forward with his costume
pictures, &ldquo;Luther as a Chorister in Eisenach&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Luther in his Household at Wittenberg,&rdquo; every one was enraptured
with the exquisite truthfulness of his portrayal of archaic life. At the
World&rsquo;s Exhibition of 1855 he had another magnificent success with
three pictures executed in old German style. These were &ldquo;The Mass in
Honour of the Antwerp Burgomaster Barthel de Haze,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Walk before
the Gate,&rdquo; and &ldquo;New Year&rsquo;s Day in Flanders.&rdquo; His return from Paris,
where he was the only foreigner except Cornelius who had received the great
gold medal, took the form of a triumphal progress in Antwerp, where he
was greeted with illuminations, torchlight processions, and laurel wreaths
made in gold. He was held to be the most eminent master since Quentin
Matsys, the Jan van Eyck of the nineteenth century. In the Brussels Salon
he appeared as a prince of art, before whom criticism made obeisance, and
for whose pictures special shrines were erected. He was striking, not merely
as an artist, but as a man: his stately figure was known to every one in
Antwerp, and was pointed out to strangers as one of the sights of the
place. In 1867, when he again received the medal in Paris, the Antwerp
Cercle Artistique had a medal struck to commemorate an event of such
importance in Belgian art. His decease, on 25th August 1869, threw the
whole town into mourning; the windows in the town hall, where he had
painted his last pictures, were hung with black, and the announcement
of his death pasted up on great placards at the street corners. &ldquo;<i>Leys is
ons</i>&rdquo; ran the phrase in the speech made by the burgomaster over his open
grave. To-day his statue stands on the Boulevard Leys, and his house
is noted down in Baedecker, like those of Matsys and Floris, Rubens and
Jordaens.</p>

<p>Leys was thus a favourite child of fortune. Enthusiastic applause showered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page370" id="page370"></a>370</span>
him with fame and laurels. But it is natural that posterity should find a
good deal to cancel in these titles of honour.</p>

<p>Through Leys the history of art was not enriched with anything new.
His delicate art&mdash;severe in outline&mdash;which goes back directly to the peculiar
manner of the fifteenth century, is in itself not without merit. But how
much of it belongs to the nineteenth century? To what extent has the
painter stood independent and on his own peculiar ground? He could draw
a Van Eyck which might be taken for an original. He seems like an old
master gone astray by chance amongst the moderns. His knowledge of the
sixteenth century is marvellous. In fact, he was a visionary who saw the
past as clearly as though he had lived in the midst of it. The men he paints
are his contemporaries. He has drawn them from life in the year of grace
1493, and they make no gesture nor grimace which might not be four hundred
years old. Yet that means that he was not an original genius, but merely
one who gave an adroit reproduction of a formula already in existence. And
much as he affected to be the contemporary of Lucas Cranach and Quentin
Matsys, he had not their simplicity: where they painted life he painted the
shadow of their realism. Surrounded by old pictures, breviaries, and missals,
he contented himself with copying the still forms of Gothic miniatures instead
of living nature. He went so deeply into the pictures of the Antwerp town
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page371" id="page371"></a>371</span>
hall that he followed the old masters in their very errors of perspective;
and though even the most childish confusion between foreground and background
does not disturb one&rsquo;s pleasure in them, because they knew no better,
it is an affectation in him, with his modern knowledge, intentionally to make
the same mistakes. Instead of being an imitator of nature, he is an imitator
of their imitation&mdash;a <i>gourmet</i> in pictorial archaism.</p>

<p>Yet it was exactly this uncompromising archaism which was of importance
for his time, and amongst his contemporaries it gives him significance as a
reformer. He is the only one amongst them who really represents the Flemish
race. Wappers was merely a Fleming from Paris, who shook off the yoke of
the Greeks to bear that of the French. Delaroche lived again in Louis Gallait,
the pupil of David. Their works had the sentiment of French tragedies,
and an artificial neatness which completely departed from the truth of nature;
the figures were combed and washed and brushed and polished, the gestures
were histrionic, the colours toned in a stereotyped fashion to effect a pleasing
<i>ensemble</i>. Leys endeavoured to be true. In his pictures he had no wish
to express ideas, but merely to bring back a fragment of &ldquo;the good old time&rdquo;
in all its brightness of life and colour. And whilst as a colourist he was bent
upon avoiding uniformity of tone and giving everything its natural character,
as a draughtsman, too, he set up, in opposition to the more patrician fluency
of others, the citizen-like angularity of an art uninfluenced by the Cinquecento.
As in Cranach, Dürer,
and Holbein, one finds in his
pictures profiles that are
vividly true; harsh and often
unwieldy heads, wrinkled
faces, and heavy, massive
shoulders resting on stunted
bodies. The human form,
with fat stomach and great
horny hands, seems almost
deformed. Everything which
the struggle for existence has
made of the image of God is
expressed in the works of
Leys for the first time since
David. Even his &ldquo;Massacre
of the Löwen Magistrates&rdquo;
showed sharp, naturalistic
physiognomies in the midst
of its confused composition,
and his &ldquo;Barthel de Haze,&rdquo;
fifteen years after, fully exemplified
this striving after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page372" id="page372"></a>372</span>
characteristic and truthful expression. None of his contemporaries has
shown himself more cool and indifferent to conventional and graceful
profile and &ldquo;beauty&rdquo; in the drawing of heads. Hatred of the academic
model made Leys bring art back to its sources. The hideousness, so often
childish, in primitive pictures was dearer to him than all Raphael. By this
emphasising of the characteristic in attitude and the expression of the face he
shows himself, although he painted historical subjects, the very antipode of
the painter of the historical school, and, at the same time, one of those
who effected the transition which led to the modern style. In setting up
quaintness and far-fetched archaism against the mannerism of the idealists,
Leys accustomed the eye again to recognise that there was something truer
than nobility of line and aristocratic pose; and, as he appealed to the old
masters as accomplices, it was impossible for æsthetic criticism to be offended.</p>

<p>In France the transition from the absolutely beautiful to the characteristic,
from types to individuals, was brought about from various sides. On the one
side Romanticism had opposed to the antique style that of the Flemish painters.
On the other side, within Classicism itself, there had been a change from the
antique and the Cinquecento to the early Italian renaissance. A new world
was opened to sculpture by the &ldquo;Florentine
Singer&rdquo; of Paul Dubois. The more
artists buried themselves in the study of
those early pioneers of realism, Donatello,
Verrochio, della Robbia, and the other
masters of the Quatrocento, the more
they found themselves fascinated by
the sparkling animation of these creations,
and sought to transfer it freely
into their own work. The fifteenth
century, with the energetic force of its
figures, its close grasp of nature, and its
pithy characterisation, which did not
even shrink from ugliness, induced
painters to go back more than they had
formerly done to the sources of real life
and to bring something of its directness
into their creations. Élie Delaunay began
to look on nature with an eye less bent
on making abstractions and regarding
all things from the standpoint of style;
he began to apprehend more clearly her
individual peculiarities and to reproduce
them more truly than had been done by
the frigid school which cast everything
into the mould of Classicism. But <i>Ernest</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page373" id="page373"></a>373</span>
<i>Meissonier</i> went a step further
when by his <i>rococo</i> pictures
he set the Dutch tradition
on a level with the Flemish
and Early Italian as a formative
influence.</p>

<p>A picture must either be
very big or very small if it is
to attract attention amid the
bustle of exhibitions. This
was probably the consideration
which led Meissonier to
his peculiar class of subjects,
and induced him to come
forward with minute Netherlandish
cabinet-pieces at the
time when the Romanticists
were issuing their huge manifestoes.
He came of a family
of petty tradespeople, and in
his youth he is said to have
taken over his father&rsquo;s business,
a trade in colonial produce.
Every morning at eight
o&rsquo;clock punctual he was at the
shop desk, and kept the books
and copied business letters,
and in this way accustomed
himself to that painstaking
and uniform carefulness
which was characteristic of him to the end of his life. His teacher, Cogniet,
was without influence on him. Even in his youth, when there went forth
the battle-cry of &ldquo;A Guelf, a Ghibelline! A Delacroix, an Ingres!&rdquo; Meissonier
sat quietly in the Louvre and copied Jan van Eyck&rsquo;s Madonna from Autun.
And a Netherlandish &ldquo;little master&rdquo; did he remain all his days. He first
earned his bread as an illustrator, but after 1834 he began to exhibit all
manner of pieces from the time of Louis <span class="sc">XIV</span> and Louis <span class="sc">XV</span>&mdash;the &ldquo;Bourgeois
hollandais rendant Visite au Bourgmestre&rdquo; of 1834, the &ldquo;Chess Players of
Holbein&rsquo;s Time,&rdquo; 1835, the &ldquo;Monk at the Sickbed,&rdquo; 1838, the &ldquo;English
Doctor&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Man Reading,&rdquo; 1840. The Salon of 1841 was for him
what that of 1824 had been for Delacroix and Ingres, and that of 1831 for
Delaroche: the cradle of his fame. &ldquo;The Chess Party&rdquo; (17 cm. high and
11 cm. broad) was the most celebrated picture of the exhibition. The great
Netherlandish &ldquo;little masters&rdquo; of the seventeenth century, till then scarcely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page374" id="page374"></a>374</span>
known and little appreciated, were brought out for comparison. &ldquo;Has
Terborg or Mieris or Meissonier done the greater work?&rdquo; was the question.
People marvelled at the sharpness of this short-sighted eye which had a perception
for the smallest details. &ldquo;Good heavens! look at the way that&rsquo;s been
done,&rdquo; said the Philistine, taking a magnifying glass; and felt himself a connoisseur
if the curator at his elbow called out, &ldquo;Not too near!&rdquo; Even his
first pictures had an accuracy and finish which defies description. It seemed
as if a most admirable Netherlandish painter in miniature scale had arisen.
The execution of his design in colours was as slow, careful, and laborious as
were his preparatory studies for costume: every touch was altered and altered
again; many a picture which was almost ready was thrown aside, scraped
out, and completely recast. Not hot-headed enthusiasts, but &ldquo;connoisseurs,&rdquo;
has Meissonier conquered in this fashion. Those readers, philosophers, card-players,
drinkers, smokers, flute-players and violin-players, engravers, painters
and amateurs, horsemen and farm-servants, brawlers and bravoes, from the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, which he painted year after year, were
soon the most coveted pictures in every superior private collection. In 1884
he was able to celebrate his jubilee as an artist with an exhibition of one hundred
and fifty pictures of the kind.
And as they would have gone dirt
cheap if they had been bought for
their weight in gold, the public
accustomed itself to buy them for
their weight in thousand-franc
notes.</p>

<p>The present age no longer
looks up to these exercises of
patience with the same vast admiration,
but it should not therefore
be forgotten what Meissonier
was for his time.</p>

<p>To begin with, though painted
at a time when painting was regarded
as an auxiliary, and an
invaluable one, to history, his
pictures tell no story. These
personages of Meissonier&rsquo;s take
part in no comedy; they occupy
themselves, some in smoking,
some in drinking, others in playing
cards, and others again in doing
nothing whatever. Whether they
made their entry as musketeer or
philosophers, as lackeys or gallants,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page375" id="page375"></a>375</span>
as scholars or <i>bonvivants</i>,
they did not pose and had no
ambition to seem men of wit
and spirit, they plunged into
no adventurous deeds and related
no anecdotes: they were
content to be well painted. And
so amongst all the French painters
of the historical picture of manners
Meissonier was the one who
had the secret of giving his works
an entirely peculiar <i>cachet</i> of
striking and realistic truth to
nature. His figures, marvellously
painted, and at the same time
animated and natural in expression,
wear the costume of our
ancestors with the utmost self-possession,
and fit into their modish
<i>rococo</i> surroundings as if they
had been poured into a mould.
Meissonier reached the truth of
nature in the total effect of his
pictures by first in reality arranging
his interiors, and the still-life
they contained, as a congruous whole. The rooms, window niches, and
firesides which he reproduced in his pictures were in his own house and
his studios, with every detail ready to hand. He bought bronzes, trinkets,
and ornaments, genuine productions of the <i>rococo</i> period, by the hundred
thousand, and kept them by him. His models were obliged, for weeks and
often for months, actually to wear the velvet and silken costumes in which
he made use of them; then he painted them with the greatest fidelity to
nature, and without troubling himself about anecdotic incident. What he
rendered was not a story invented and put together piecemeal, but a
wholesome piece of reality, pictorially conceived. And if this was primarily
composed of costumes and furniture belonging to the eighteenth century,
the transition to the natural treatment of modern life was at the same time
made possible, and was accomplished by Meissonier himself, at a later period,
in his battle pieces.</p>

<p>But he had only painted men: the physiognomy of the feminine Sphinx
remained for him an eternal riddle. A wide field was here offered to his followers.
Fauvelet, Chavet, and Brillouin stepped into Meissonier&rsquo;s shoes, and gave
his <i>rococo</i> fine gentlemen their better halves. The first two made simple
imitations. Brillouin devoted himself to the comic <i>genre</i>: he arranged his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page376" id="page376"></a>376</span>
pictures prettily, was a good observer, and painted tolerably well. The last
of these Meissonierists is Vibert, chiefly known in the present day by his
cardinals and other scarlet dignitaries, whom he represents in water-colours
and oils with a certain touch of malice. He paints them gouty, gluttonising,
or tipsy, in one or more cases in every picture&mdash;which does not contribute to
make his works interesting. But originally he had a sympathetic superior
talent, and will always claim a modest place in the group of the modern &ldquo;little
masters.&rdquo; His &ldquo;Gulliver Bound,&rdquo; and also the Spanish and Turkish scenes
which occupied him after a tour in the East, are extremely pleasing and delicately
painted costume pieces, gleaming in sunlight; and in their sparkling,
capricious workmanship they sometimes almost verge on Fortuny.</p>

<p>On the German side of the Rhine <i>Adolf Menzel</i> was the great pioneer of
truth. The history of German art must do him honour as one who first had
the genius and courage to break away from conventional forms of phrasing,
and bring the truth of nature into art: at first, as in the case of Meissonier, it
was nature in masquerade; but it was nature seen and rendered with all the
sincerity of a man to whom the art of pose was wanting from the very first.</p>

<p>Even in the thirties, at a time when &ldquo;The Sorrowing Royal Pair&rdquo; and
the &ldquo;Leonora&rdquo; by Lessing, &ldquo;The Soldier and his Child,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Sick Councillor,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;The Sons of Edward&rdquo; by Hildebrandt, and &ldquo;The Lament of
the Jews&rdquo; by Bendemann, together with the works of Cornelius, met with
the enthusiastic applause of the million, Menzel
looked into the world with a sharp glance,
undisturbed by idealism; and what enabled
him to do this was his unwavering and
thoroughly Prussian healthiness, which knew
no touch of sentimentalism&mdash;a certain coldness
and hardness, that sensible, reflective North
German trait, which often expresses itself in
these days (when German art has become
subtle and superior) by a crude naturalism in
the Berlin painting. In the beginning of the
century, however, it set the Berlin painting, as
art of the healthy human understanding, in
salutary contrast to the sickliness of Munich
and Düsseldorf. Even eighty years ago the
people of Berlin were too acute and practical
to be Romanticists. The artists whom Menzel
found active and honoured at his arrival were
Schadow and Rauch, and beside them, as
representatives of the <i>grande peinture</i>, Begas
and Wach. But even these, who were most
under the influence of the sentimental tendency,
were justly recognised by the thorough-going
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page377" id="page377"></a>377</span>
Romanticists on the Rhine as never having given an unqualified
homage to their flag. A clear, realistic method was dominant in the
art of Berlin. And in this respect it was as much a corrective&mdash;and one
by no means to be undervalued&mdash;against the inflated sentiment of Munich
as against the weak and sickly sentimentalism of Düsseldorf, with its
knights and monks and noble maidens. Even Cornelius, who had been
called to Berlin by Frederick William IV&mdash;that King of the Romanticists
on the throne of the eminently unromantic Hohenzollerns&mdash;found himself
helpless against the ruling taste. And here only, in the stronghold of
sharply accentuated common sense, where the old Prussian sobriety set
bounds to the twilight kingdom of Romanticism, could Adolf Menzel attain
to greatness. His Berlinism kept him from lingering in empty space. To
the taste of to-day, formed from Fontainebleau, he will seem too much a
creature of the understanding and too little a creature of feeling. Boecklin
hit him off admirably when, on being asked what he thought of Menzel, he
answered: &ldquo;He is a great scholar.&rdquo; A comparison between him and Mommsen
especially suggests itself&mdash;a great scholar, a mordant satirist, and a brilliant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page378" id="page378"></a>378</span>
journalist. But this sober scepticism, this cool spirit of investigation, this
&ldquo;heartlessness&rdquo; observing all things with the eye of a judge in a court of
judicial inquiry, were what cleared the ground for modern art. No one has
done more than Menzel for those rulers in the kingdom of dreams who from
pure dreaming have never been able to learn anything. He has helped to
set them steadily on their feet, and to accustom their sight, vitiated by idealism,
once more to truth and nature.</p>

<p>Menzel was almost the only one in Germany who could draw and paint in
the time before the French influence had made itself felt. The struggle for
existence had forced him to learn. In the year of Bismarck&rsquo;s birth there was
born in Breslau the man destined to glorify, first the greatness of the old kingdom
of the Fredericks, and then that of new imperial Prussia. Cast out at an early
age on the inhospitable wilderness of life, he came to Berlin, poor and lonely,
and not so much for the sake of art as for gain. There he sat in his cheerless
attic, without a servant; and wrapped up in his plaid, with a coffee-pot on
one side and a pencil on the other, he looked out over the roofs of the vast town,
the most brilliant epoch of which he was predestined to depict and to conquer
by his art. Since it brought in profit sooner than anything else, he had made
himself familiar with the technique of reproduction; and having devoted
himself in particular to the
newly discovered art of
lithography, he turned out
<i>ménus</i>, New Year cards, vignettes
for occasional poems,
etc., and in things of this sort
displayed a genuine affinity
of spirit with Chodowiecki
and Gottfried Schadow.
From his twelfth year onwards
he had not only assured
his own existence, but
even supported his family
by such work; and in the
hours he spent over it he
laid the groundwork for becoming
the master of masters
amongst the moderns.
Menzel is not merely a man
who owed to himself everything
which he afterwards
became, who learnt to draw
by his own unassisted endeavours,
who mastered oil-painting
without a teacher,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page379" id="page379"></a>379</span>
and went further in it than any one
of his generation&mdash;a man who found
out entirely by himself new methods
and combinations in water-colours and
gouache; but if it is asked who was
the greatest German illustrator, the
man who did most in Germany to
advance the art of woodcut engraving,
the one German historical painter of
the century who was entirely original,
who really knew a bygone period so
exactly that he could venture on
painting it, the name of Menzel is invariably
uttered.</p>

<p>Even in the twelve simple lithographs
which appeared in 1837,
&ldquo;Memorable Events from Prussian
History in the Brandenburg Era,&rdquo; the
&ldquo;scholar&rdquo; Menzel stands ready as the
actual historian of the Prussian kingdom.
In an age which took its
pleasure in a vaporous, sentimental enthusiasm for the mediæval splendour
of the empire, he was the one who as a youth of twenty pointed to the
corner-stones of Prussian history in the Brandenburg times; he was the
only man of his age who refused to blow the horn of the mawkish Romanticists,
and still less that of the impassioned historical painters who came
after them. For his were no theatrically tricked out scenes of tragedy, no
touching situations; they had nothing poetical; and just as little were they
tedious pictures of ceremonies or spectacular pieces. Striking characterisation
and sparkling vividness were united here to the most painstaking study of
nature and history, carried down to the peculiarities of costume and weapons.
History was not arranged in accordance with academic formulæ, but delineated
as if from life with absorbing truthfulness. Everything was expressed simply
and sincerely, without exciting passages, and without conventional sentiment
pumped out of models. Every epoch had its historical physiognomy, and
costume was reduced to its proper subordinate place.</p>

<p>Franz Kugler was the first who understood this sincere and pithy art.</p>

<p>The Life of Napoleon had appeared, at that time, in Paris, with illustrations
by Horace Vernet, and it had a considerable sale in Germany also. This
gave a Berlin publisher the idea of a similar German work, and Kugler commissioned
Menzel to illustrate his biography of Frederick the Great. It is
almost impossible to pay sufficient honour to the influence which this book
on Frederick has had on German art. It made an epoch in the history of
wood engraving. The technique of this craft had been completely forgotten
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page380" id="page380"></a>380</span>
in Germany ever since the beginning of the century, or used only for the
production of rough trade-marks for tobacco; Menzel had to invent it afresh
and teach an engraving school of his own before the four hundred masterly
plates of the book were made possible.</p>

<tr><td class="captionx f80">MENZEL.&emsp;&emsp;FREDERICK THE GREAT AND HIS TUTOR.</td></tr></table>

<p>But it became more revolutionary still for the æsthetic ideas of the time.
Menzel had not set himself to produce a sequence of pictures, displaying
events and heroes in the most ideal situations possible, but made it his business
to sift the entire life of Frederick the Great to its minutest particulars. And
here began that philological study of records which Menzel has carried on
with the strenuous labour of an archivist down to the present day. Old
Fritz had been caught by Chodowiecki in the way in which he has since lived
in the popular imagination: as the old man on horseback, with his bent
shoulders and his crutch-stick, holding a review, and as the philosopher, the
statesman, the warrior and hero in the most manifold situations. Menzel,
in whom the spirit of Chodowiecki lived again, only needed to begin where
the latter left off. Stepping on the antiquarian material of Chodowiecki,
he worked his way into the great period on which Frederick and Voltaire
have set the stamp of their spirit, as Mommsen worked his way into Roman
history. He read through whole libraries; he copied all attainable portraits.
With scientific pedantry he did not forget to study the buttons and the cut of
the trousers in the uniforms, and did not rest until he knew the old grenadiers
as a corporal knows his men. Using these labours as preparation, he proceeded
to call up old Fritz and his time with the objectivity of an historian,
just as they were, and not as they had better have been. Sureness of treatment
even in the finest details, accurate mastery of the surroundings, and everything
which had made Meissonier&rsquo;s appearance so important for France,
was attained at one stroke for Germany. But the very simplicity of what
was offered&mdash;both in style and technique&mdash;prevented Menzel from being at
the beginning accepted in his own country as an &ldquo;historical painter.&rdquo; He
was blamed for disregarding &ldquo;beauty,&rdquo; and it was said that a &ldquo;higher&rdquo;
artistic perception was sealed from him. On the other hand, the book laid
the foundation of Menzel&rsquo;s position in France, and was, moreover, the work on
which, for a long time, the appreciation
of modern German art in foreign
countries was based.</p>

<td class="tcr f90 pb2">THE ROUND TABLE AT SANS-SOUCI.</td></tr></table>

<p>Thenceforth Menzel had a kind of
monopoly in this subject, and when
in 1840 Frederick William <span class="sc">IV</span> had the
works of the great king published in
an <i>édition de luxe</i>, Menzel, amongst
others, was entrusted with the illustration.
Every one of the thirty volumes
contains portraits of Frederick&rsquo;s contemporaries
which were engraved by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page381" id="page381"></a>381</span>
Mandel and others after original pictures of the period. Menzel had an
apparently subordinate task. He was commissioned to make two hundred
drawings for wood engraving; these, however, do not appear on separate
pages, but were destined to be incorporated in the text as tail-pieces,
vignettes, and the like. This was the great work which occupied him
during the forties; and in these headings and tail-pieces to the works
of Frederick the Great he showed, for the first time, that he was not
merely a learned investigator of sources, but was full of brilliant <i>aperçus</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page382" id="page382"></a>382</span>
One has to read Frederick the Great before one can do full justice to the
acuteness and ready resource, the subtlety and pungency of the artist&rsquo;s pencil.
All æsthetic categories of realistic and idealistic art are scattered like dust
before these creations, in which the most fantastic ideas are embodied with
the whole force of the realistic power of our days.</p>

<p>When he had done honour to the military comrades of the great ruler
in his work of wood engraving, &ldquo;Heroes of War and Peace in the Time of
King Frederick,&rdquo; and thus made the epoch his own through a decade of busy
labour, Menzel, draughtsman though he was, turned round and became the
painter of Frederick the Great. In the history of art there have never been
two names more intimately connected with each other. Menzel was a
strenuous worker, who never knew the passion for woman, either because he
had no time for it, or because he despised women after being despised by
them as a poor, hard-featured student of art; a man whose great bald head
appeared at Berlin subscription-balls amid groups of brilliant cavaliers and
queens of beauty, fashion, and grace, surrounded by the rustle of their silks
and in the whirlpool of a dancing throng, gleaming with colour and sparkling
with gold and jewels; and appeared there simply because this world interested
him as something to be painted. He was a recluse who went into society
solely to make observations for his art, and when there was chary of speech and
much feared. He was always a busy experimentalist, so that his two hands
gradually became equally dexterous; at the age of eighty he could still sketch
with firm and accurate strokes while travelling in a railway carriage.</p>

<p>Though he had hitherto devoted himself to drawing, he had also by his own
independent study made himself familiar with the technique of oils; and he
now became such a master of colour as few were at that time. In the middle
of the century were painted those two masterpieces which now hang in the
Berlin National Gallery, &ldquo;The Round Table at Sans-Souci&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Concert
of Frederick the Great.&rdquo; These are historical pictures, the authority and
importance of which cannot be shaken by even the most modern of critics.
If what is called the spirit of an age has ever been embodied in pictures, it is
embodied here, where the master-minds of the eighteenth century are assembled
at their genial round table. The scene is the oval dining-room of the castle.
The meal is over, and there reigns a genial after-dinner mood, champagne
sparkles in the glasses and a smart rivalry of wit is in progress. Afternoon has
crept on, and a cold, subdued daylight floods the room, in which every fragment
of the architecture, from the inlaid floor to the gilded capitals of the pillars and
the stucco of the arched ceiling, every piece of furniture and every chandelier,
bears the wayward grace of the high-<i>rococo</i> period; all is comprehended with
the most intimate knowledge. In the second picture a fine candlelight is
glimmering over the scene. Frederick is just beginning to play the flute, and
the musicians of the string quartet pause, to strike in again after the solo.
The Court is grouped to the left: the ladies in gilded easy-chairs, and their
cavaliers behind them. The tapers of the chandelier and the sconces branching
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page383" id="page383"></a>383</span>
from the wall shed over everything their prismatic, broken light reflected by
the mirrors, and fill the fantastic, capricious, graceful, comfortable apartment,
here with streaming brightness, there with a finely modulated twilight. Only
Menzel could have conjured up in so convincing a manner the brilliancy of this
Court festival of the past.</p>

<p>Here is that exactness which an historical picture must have if it makes
any claim to intrinsic worth. Whilst the ordinary historical painters were
content to transmute dressed-up models into types of the universally human,
and to put historical labels on their frames, Menzel succeeded in really penetrating
a bygone age in an artistic spirit, and in making it live again for the
present generation. He did not burrow to discover another dim historical
personage every year, but confined himself to one hero&mdash;to the figure of the
Prussian hero-king, familiar to every child, and still living in the popular
imagination; and he learnt to master the time of this favourite hero as if he
had been old Fritz himself. Menzel had never heard him blowing on his flute,
and never sat at table with him in Sans-Souci, but the painting of these scenes
comes out true and life-like in the artist&rsquo;s work, because the past history of his
country had become as vivid to him as his own age. His &ldquo;Battle of Hochkirch&rdquo;
rises to tragical grandeur, precisely because everything that is outwardly
impassioned is far from him. His &ldquo;Frederick the Great on a Journey,&rdquo;
where the king is inspecting territories alter the war and ordering the rebuilding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page384" id="page384"></a>384</span>
of demolished houses, his &ldquo;Frederick&rsquo;s Meeting with Joseph II in Niesse,&rdquo;
and all the other pictures of the sequence, by their marvellous naturalness and
intense vividness, and by their freedom from pompous phrasing, stand alone
in an age dominated by empty sentiment. Menzel, who never laid his sketch-book
down from the time he was twelve years old, found a subject of pictorial
interest in everything that he saw around him, until finally he acquired the
power of moving with natural self-possession in a period that was not his own.
By the roundabout way through the <i>rococo</i> period he has taught us to understand
ourselves. In his pictures an apparently paradoxical problem has been
solved. An intense feeling for modern reality waked to new life the past,
that same past which no one had approached with success by the way of
idealism.</p>

<p>And if we look over the whole development of modern art it strikes us as a
remarkable fact that the most concrete spirits, the most thorough masters of
technique, like Meissonier and Menzel, were precisely those who ventured to
advance into the present. When they had crossed the province of the <i>rococo</i>
period, avoided by all scholastic art, they had arrived again at the epoch when
Mengs and David had interrupted the natural course of the history of art,
one hundred years before. About 1750 the fateful movement towards the
antique had been accomplished; in 1820 the Middle Ages had the upper hand;
in 1830 the Cinquecento was in the ascendant with Cornelius and Ingres; in
1840 the seventeenth century was awakened through Delacroix and Wappers;
and in 1850, after &ldquo;the courses of the centuries were sphered&rdquo;&mdash;to use the
phrase of Cornelius&mdash;Meissonier and Menzel painted things which had not
appeared worth representing to the painters of 1750, blinded, as they were,
by the glory of the antique. Not less striking is it that the nearer the historical
subject came to the present
the truer to nature did the
picture become, and the more
did it outwardly change in its
features. It has shrivelled
from the huge scale of David
and Cornelius to the miniature
scale of Meissonier and
Menzel, and to some extent
it thus leaves its further
development to be guessed.
At no distant time the historical
picture will be overthrown,
and the picture from
modern life, hitherto but
shyly handled and on the
smallest scale, will swell to
life size. History itself,
serious history, clings merely to the rock-bed of old costume. One generation
had used it with an abstract purpose as a substratum for philosophical
ideas; others had made scenical pieces with its aid; a third
generation turned it over for piquant traits and anecdotes. The last and
greatest generation had finally come to handle it quite familiarly and
humanly and without affected dignity. Their works protested against all
idealism; and this expressed itself, in drawing, by their making use of the
true instead of the &ldquo;beautiful&rdquo; line; in colour, by a fresher tint corresponding
with nature rather than with the conventional ideal of beauty.</p>

<p>Nobility of line was paramount in Gallait and Piloty, movement with
grand, kingly gestures, lofty dignity, aristocratic bearing, knightliness, and a
conventional piling up of rich stuffs, alluring to the eye. Leys, Menzel, and
Meissonier were the first who sacrificed beauty to truth, or, more properly, who
perceived that a beauty without truth is not really beautiful. They came
gradually and by an indirect way to this knowledge as they studied German
and Netherlandish masters instead of the Italians, and set up the angular,
natural outlines of the Germans against the grace of the Latin masters, which
had become banal through a lengthy course of imitation. And thus a return
was made to the manner of
our true ancestors, which had
been forgotten during half a
century. The place of the
Antinous heads of Gallait
was taken by physiognomies
of vigorous characterisation;
gesticulating heroes made
way for peaceful, quiet persons,
who did not consider
themselves under an obligation
to acquire artistic
citizenship by a parade of
attitude, but appeared in
their picture as they were in
reality. Impassioned movement
yielded quietly to arms
hanging downwards and natural
postures. Even the
traditional rules of concave
and convex composition were
broken so that the free play
of life might more easily
come to its rights. Not less
did all three show themselves
true painters by preferring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page388" id="page388"></a>388</span>
rightness of observation and truth and delicacy of reproduction to anecdote
and richness of invention, and by feeling the need of painting figures in
their real surroundings. Instead of the conventional velvet and brocade
stuffs, and the folios everywhere and nowhere in place, the settles and the
brass caskets, there was a naturally painted fragment of reality, authentically
reflecting the whole atmosphere of the period. The treatment of
nature, hitherto idealistic and arbitrary, became synthetic and naturalistic.
There was no more abstraction, but direct observation of the man and his
<i>milieu</i>. And if, for the time being, this <i>milieu</i> was a <i>rococo milieu</i>, artificially
reconstructed so that it could be realistically transferred to the picture, Menzel
and Meissonier, even on account of this realism, would have to be reckoned as
outposts of the modern tendency, and as having very decided points of contact
with it; and this, even if they had not themselves actually become the pioneers
of modernity, forcing their way through against the literary and historical
movement. It is owing to their works in the past that the preference of the
public turned less and less to compositions of fine sentiment, even though
grounded on more attentive observation, and that artists began to regard
reality as the most important element, the point of departure for every picture.
Thus life itself came to be painted, and preparation was made for the coming
demand of a new generation, who wished no more to see old heroes, but
themselves, in the mirror of art.</p>
